Meanwhile I reviewed a fake I watch which i paid for £10.00 which has alot more use then this !
"Okay, let's be honest, the Meta Quest is technologically more functional and advanced than this $10,000+ Apple device, for a lot less money."
"Id you want to make sure you cover the entire floor while you're vacuuming, those coins need to be smaller and much more densely packed.
And so what you don't have the youtube app? You have a browser, so just use that."
"Yes sir, i will"
I’ll stick with the Meta Quest 3! Apple could never!!!!

I just tried it in the Apple Store and I could see soooooo many pixels
"vr still needs it's killer app, and that sure aint gonna be Apple or Meta, we really need another big player, or nintendo"
"Honestly the most day-to-day ""killer"" features I see with AR are 1. Virtual monitors (huge display, ergonomic, reduced eye strain) 2. An amazing media consumption device. If people could nail down all the miniaturization while preserving the quality of the displays and the fluidity of input, I think that's the next ""iPhone moment""."
This is why his reviews are worthless. People hated it universally.
Where’s the watch pick up?
I love the blue shirt guy
"I saw an app for immersive videos called ""NOC NOK"", featuring pretty girls. It's quite nice."
"Early today Apple Vision Pro, and WOW  It’s more than a VR headset it’s like stepping into the future! Immersive, seamless, and mind-blowing. You can’t wait to go back once you’ve experienced it. Apple has truly outdone itself again!"
i would get dual 4090 in stead
23:25 minority report come to mind
"13:14 yo, I completely understand, the thing sort of bends reality"
"i did not know apple had this headset.  until someone had told me.  i am pretty good keeping up with techy world since i am a pc tech.  but, lately i fell little short of it.  not knowing about this headset or even zfold 5 or 4.  you would think with the high price tag of this head set would be ten times better.  i would have to settle for a much lower end vr headseet like the meta quest.  i did try meta quest and i was blown away with vr.  i think in the near future we will be like surrogates.  having vr headsets on all day while our counter parts will do all the work for us."
This was so helpful!! Thank you.
Well that failed... That should be apple's motto
"YOMMY BORGOR??""???????               :( :( :("

Only one thing that I don’t like it. No Netflix app ;’((
They should add pop our AirPods for the max. It’d be like a double deal and people wouldn’t need to worry about audio spilling out.
"I honestly just take an oculus, but i appreciate apple trying something new that isn't the same iPhone"
This thing NEEDS a hardware keyboard and mouse. It could be borderline practical with all the devices it can replace if they’d just accept that people are going to use this thing either sitting at a desk or on a couch
Can’t wait until Apple makes the contact lens. Ouuu and the little chips that go into the back of the neck. Gonna be Awesome
No YouTube app is crazy!
"I really like this idea, but I'm too broke to buy even the iphone 15 pro (I bought the iphone 15 though)"
"I think look-based UX is just as bad as it's always been. Meta's UX for controllerless input, while it is admittedly a bit floaty in its current form and has some trouble deciding what angle to draw the ray from, it is in concept significantly more friendly. There is in fact a reason why we've not all tossed out our mice for Tobi eye trackers. A pointing method divorced from your look position is just nicer to use.

And I'm sure with how much high end tech they crammed into this device, their implementation of hands as pointers would have been just as smooth as their position tracking, and way more reliable than meta's version. Keep in mind, this thing costs 8 times as much as a quest 3, so that's not a dig at meta, apple just has more data to work with due to having more and higher end sensors. As alluded to though, apple does have a stick up their butt about reinventing wheels all the time, so this is likely different for the sake of different, even though this is only different from other look based UX in that you pinch fingers to click instead of staring long enough for the circle to fill up. This is an upgrade on that for sure, but if you've got sophisticated hand tracking already, why only use it to simulate a mouse button and scroll wheel?

I think this was a mistake, and a missed opportunity to have the best controller-free UX on the market. Instead we have two unideal UXes; meta's, which is more natural but suffers from having not quite accurate enough tracking, and apple's which has high accuracy tracking, but only lets you point with your eyeballs.

For what it's worth, eye tracking is also significantly easier to do, and the quest three has their version of look based UX (the old one where you have to fill a circle to click) but it would take little effort to add a look+pinch mode that would be pretty much identical to apples UX. Which is just to say, it seems really odd that they committed so hard to ""no controllers"", had expensive high end hardware, but then went with a UX that feels like a downgrade from the $500 headset's UX."
When I think about the fact that this is 15000 romanian lei in my country
Who’s also watching this on an Apple Vision Pro
I tried these I was speechless it’s amazing
For $999.00 I might think about. 5000$ Canadian is 1000% ripoff
I know it tracks eye movement but what about someone with a lazy eye?
The persona reminded me of heavily modded sims game
"Pretty sure it is yesterday's tech and Apple is recouping R&D costs. That's insulting to me in a sense...to sell me something for $4,000 that's already obsolete. Otherwise, I'd already have one."
I've watched your reviews about these and one thing is lacking. The sound side of things - you skip over it - why? It is the factor that will determine if I buy these and I cannot find anything anywhere. Can you use iPod instead at the same time? How much 'leakage' is there if you are on a sensitive call do people hear you that much? Appreciate your reviews well done. When watching a movie - how close until someone can hear?
6000 aus dollars ...no thanks
Entertained to death.
wait to see apple intelligence with Vision pro
Can it read product labels?
Apple really should've shipped this with elden ring installed
Blah blah blah what’s the battery life?
Why You Not put actual Review About product and downfall of it
Why only this video of Mkdhd works in PIP mode in free YouTube ? Whyyyy
"I have the vision pro and a meta quest 3, and not only do I think the meta quest 3 is better for its value, I thinks it’s better because the vision pro is just a wen browser in VR, and along with hundreds upon thousands of games on the quest 3, the quest 3 also has a web browser😂"
I just read they didn't sell many of these and a lot of people returned them? You seemed so excited about it 4 months ago.
People with glasses what about them
"Imagine immersing yourself in an environment way above our life's paygrade, just to take them off and be depressed once again"
"it’s definitely a cool thing to use but using it in countries like China or Iran or any other countries that you cannot live without VPNs, even these apps that support the VR headset, most of them don’t even work, like yeah it’s a bummer that we don’t have the YouTube app and you can use Safari, but if you don’t have a VPN, how can you watch YouTube, Netflix doesn’t support at all or Disney+, Apple TV does though and some other built in apps, Apple Maps doesn’t, so.. is it really worth it for people in these countries? it’s generally speaking not worth it for people like in US or Canada, let alone for Chinese and Iranians"
Meta quest 3 immersed app:
After taking off the headset it does leave a feeling of a sense of void
I'm glad I'm old.

Could you review the Visor vr glasses?
"A $250 headset has a fully fleshed out game and app store, a higher refresh rate and a higher field of view, than a $3500 headset.

Thats concerning."
"My problem with apple and this idea of the vision pro is that while they want to have it be a productivity device, it lacks so much of what makes a productivity device. I got a quest 2 last week and i still think vr is a gimmick (because it is) i enjoy it more now that the software has caught up. When the quest 2 got real games it went from living in its gimmick to being a cool and fun to use device. If the vision pro doesnt get more software to support it then it will just stay this super gimmicky device. What murders it tho is how god damn expensive it is, for $4k it should be able to do more than a $300, less than 10% of the cost for way more support and entertainment. It has potential sure but they came out swinging with a metal stick while the competition has assult rifles.

The iphone compairsion also kinda doesnt work since the iphone was literally the first of its kind to do anything like it, no other phone worked that way or was that useful as a package, the vision pro is swimming in real competition who've been at it longer. really they werent the first for any of this, they're not the best, and they're not doing it that different. All apple have done is pushed out a device that does exactly what the rest are doing but are putting in different focus for an extreme price. In short the vision pro is just ps vita, an overpowered device with tons of potential thats more expensive than its competition with far less supporting software than the competition and what little software it has amounts to doing the same thing on it that you can you do with the company's main offering. I hope it doesnt have the same fate as the vita but this thing has been out for months and has yet to do something with its potential so my hopes arent high"
I still have absolutely no idea why anyone would want to use this over their own two eyes and a smartphone
"I develop with the quest 3 and that moment where you expect something that you placed somewhere in augmented reality to be there in real reality without headset has happened to me too several times, expecting my debugging screen to be hanging in front of the window and then being surprised when it isn't."
"This was a good video. Although far more advanced, I kept thinking of the Microsoft Hololens and how it seemed way ahead of it's time. Do you think Apple might at some point pivot away from Eyesight to a more translucent implementation?"
"This video should be titled ""The worst Apple product I've ever reviewed... for now"""
"Too expensive. I love the tech and what it can do, and the future it has but damn, at these prices I'll never have one unless it's a work thing and i don't have to pay for it. It's telling that the most exciting thing about the product is how good future generations might be. Doesn't really have enough of a reason on its own, it's just like you say with other products. Consider it's value based on what it offers now, not what it will be, supposedly. If it gets better an cheaper but it then, not now hoping that will happen."
"I'd think about trying it if it was jailbroken (like a real computer should be. if you can't do what you want with it, it's a toy) and had a good keyboard input."
"I will wait for the cheaper, version in a couple of years (I think I waited the same amount of time to buy an iPhone - I started buying mine at version 7)."
Add pokemon go and you got yourself a headset that’ll fly off the shelves I promise you
"The difference between the first smartphone and smartwatch taking off and this taking off is that you didnt have to pay $3500 for it, so the lack of features _combined_ with the price tag is definitely a big deal breaker considering most people can already do all of this right now without the headset"
"Your points about comfort of VR headset straps is pretty accurate IMO. But it's kind of a catch 22. The A cloth or soft rubber strap is comfortable, flexible, flexible, but requires you to tighten things enough that it applies pressure to your face. On the other hand a hard plastic halo style strap can balance things and keep the headset comfortable over long periods of time. But if you tighten the halo strap enough that movement wont dislodge it, the hard plastic halo setup gives me headaches due to squeezing my head."
"Once Mac Virtual Display can display multiple desktop spaces, or integrates some variation of Mission Control with a simple swipe left or right, (thinking Minority Report), that’s when the Vision Pro will probably replace or augment my hardware displays. That’s the killer app for me."
"If you cannot bend the reality, try vurtuality"
"I just had a demo and thought it was great however, they are to heavy for me so I didn't purchase them."
"My only gripe about this product is that they did not design well enough to sweat in.  Waterproof.  Many of us exercising at home, outside and gym with the help of visual aids from our phones.  This would be excellent for that."
This PH transition music had me make a doubletake a couple times.
"If it's worse for darker skin people to use, you better belive Apple will drop it. All it's gonna take is one ""Dis racist""  comment when it comes to the eye contact feature, and they will end it."
If someone wear glasses how it is quality
"You don't get to call you VR headset realeased 12 years after the Oculus Rift a ""first generation product"""
It’s similar to meta 3 but way more unaffordable
Awesome review. Thanks!
So what you’re saying here is that they released it before it was optimal so that they can say for the new iteration it’s new and improved and charge people more money to buy the new and upcoming Vision Pro plus.
it has ZERO application
Well sometimes I try to pass the song mimicking the gesture you'd do on AirPods Pro when I'm not using them so I guess is an acquired thing from using a product a lot
Can you rent an Apple Vision Pro?
He obviously overhyped overpriced apple products
Hey apple-paid content creator! Have you heard of quest 3?
Need
Intro song: AllttA - Duel World
I own 6 apple products and find one or two are not so often used but have a niche function. So if invested in this rather than apple stocks it needs to deliver quality escapist entertainment from modern life. This is its niche function for a modernist how needs moments of transcendence. Therefore the buyer needs to bet it will definitely value for price and that is questionable. So no need for fancy features like eyes on glass but a foxed product that delivers authentic escapism.
Am I the only one who is absolutely mortified by this? Am I the last sane person on earth?
Check the glass trunk from sony I 5hink it came out on 1998 or 1999.
Always exciting with Apple.  Hate to reflect on how many Apple products we have.
Does sombody know why I can play this video out side of the YouTube app without an YouTube Premium subscription?
In about a decade we’ll all be walking around with a functional and well-engineered E.D.I.T.H.
Ill buy an vision pro if i get 50k likes...😅😊
So good!
"Question: Can you collaborate, using 2 Apple Vision Pros? 
I am thinking video editor and client. Like immersive screensharing. 
And they don't have to be in the same room for that."
You thumbnail  for this video is wrong.! Check again Apple AD is right!
Never saw a review from Marquee that sounds so much like a paid placement. It is such a lame product that could hardly be considered a prototype.
craaaaaaaaaaap
Just a heads up unpluging it isnt the ONLY WAY to turn it off. You turn it off like a IPHONE it will display in headset and you slide your fingers to turn off PRESS AND HOLD THE LEFT POWER BUTTON ON TOP AND THE SHUTTER BUTTON ON TOP.
Perfect!!!
"Aww in all 3 videos he missed out on a cool move. At the end, once he put on the headset and said goodbye to us, he should've just pinched two fingers together, as to close ""our window"" 😀"
"Here's an incredibly useful use case for the Apple Vision; communication for those who can't speak or move.

A app could be written where it's a dictionary type thing, and they can select words with their eyes. 

Guestures could be added, such as winks and eyebrow lifts. 

Using a custom AI model, it could learn the habits and way of ""speaking"" and allow for, I imagine, a fairly quick way of communicating!

If I've thought of this, I know somebody else has had the same idea.

It came to me while reading The Count of Monte Cristo, a character named Nortier is a paralytic who communicates through his eyes."

also Courtside Games and things like that Will 100 % be available they will want to do deals with the leagues for subscriptions or virtual tickets i heard they will do this for concerts too 
Thanks for the Info Marques"
"this is amazing i am thinking of buying this in the future 

😃"
10 years from now...cool.
"Just tested it. I also tested the Pico 4 and quest 3. I'm sorry but I was wow testing the quest 3, but was very disappointed with the vision pro."
It’s expensive
Just need Only Fans app…
You will lose your connection God with this
Too many features run me away
"Never would I want cameras, sensors, magnets, electro radiation projected directly into my eyes and strapped to my skull, so close to my brain. Never. This product will fail spectacularly."
Expensive n meta pro was similar n nothing new
You very rich can you buy it for me 😢
Your explanation extraordinary bro
I always thought this is what google glass was supposed to be. Years later we got these huge snow goggles.
No problem at 4k for these things I'll buy 22 pair. Not affordable
Does this damage eyes?
The Vision Pro looks so cool and I wish I could try it but I can’t 😔
"Sonys got the playstation vr2, looks cool playing games"
Not immersive enough. Will anxiously wait for the apple chip to be implanted in my brain.
Who all are came after watching madan gowri and a2d channel vision pro vlog? 🙌🏻
damn
Im looking forward for apple vision air
This is amazing! Thanks for the crystal clear explanation! Helped me a lot to decide to purchase or not vision pro!
"People in 2100 :

Will someone please do me the courtesy as to help me with the make/model of the second vr headset from the left towards top in the shot at 0:36 in the video? Thanks.
This looks stupid. Hope it’s the next Segway like flop.
I think this would be great for multitasting desk work. I am soo excited to use this. Also with enough time i feel like poeple will get use to knowing where their hands are and what they are doing. Kind of like learning to type with out looking at the keys.
I wonder if these might cause headaches in people suffering from migraine 🤔
Imagine someone robbing the apple store and using the apple vision pro and a mask to hide there identity 😂
why tf to make 4-5 videos about the same thing.
I need one for Christmas I need to make sure I’m good SO I CAN GO WITH A BANG!! 💥💥
imagine watching concerts with this
"I don't know why I feel like it's about to happen but  It's fascinating to ponder the possibilities that emerging technologies like brain-computer interfaces and advanced artificial intelligence could bring about. Imagine a world where individuals, even from infancy, can inhabit virtual realities tailored entirely to their desires. From fulfilling dreams of becoming a sports legend or a beloved celebrity to experiencing a life free from the troubles of our current society, the potential seems boundless.

However, amidst this allure, there are crucial questions to consider. Could such immersive virtual realities lead to a detachment from real-life relationships and experiences? Would they exacerbate societal divisions by allowing individuals to live in personalized bubbles?

Moreover, the ethical implications are profound. What happens when individuals can escape accountability for their actions or indulge in harmful behaviors without consequences? And what about the impact on our perception of reality and our appreciation for the natural world?

While technology undoubtedly offers immense benefits, we must approach these advancements with caution and introspection. Let's engage in meaningful conversations about the balance between technological innovation and our humanity, ensuring that we harness these tools to enhance rather than replace the richness of real-life experiences.

Let's discuss and delve deeper into these complex issues, considering both the potential benefits and the pitfalls of living in increasingly immersive virtual realities. After all, it's through thoughtful dialogue and reflection that we can navigate the future of technology in a way that truly benefits humanity."
Can you use your PC or do I have to use a Mac in order to use Vision pro?
I don't follow the common sense of Pass through using  camera that eventually uses the battery other than like hololens. This is a luxury use of camera to see around the room which you can always see by naked eyes but you're dollars for it. The Apple way.
Will it be a solution for night blindness 😊
"Thank you! Finally, a review that mirrors my own excitement about Apple entering, and hopefully redefining A tech category that has for a long time been stuttering. I live in the UK, yet I have an Apple Vision Pro, why? Because I’m intrigued and because it excites me. You are spot-on, it is flawed, however I’ve had so many jawdropping. wow moments using this in the first 48 hours that I’ve had it that for me it’s worth it. Great review, sir!"

"No way

"Why is no one talking about battery life ?

Everything is useless without good battery life ."
"I think you know this is going to be a scenario of the original iPhone. You know if you remember the launch of the original iPhone you remember how much hate it got. People were constantly saying that there was no way it was going to amount to anything because who would want a computer in their pocket and basically criticizing the whole premise as being a gimmick, but as we all know that obviously was wrong and we all know what it eventually led to.

I think this is going to be the same type of watershed product. It's going to basically usher in the augmented reality revolution. And I think for all the flaws of this initial product within two or three generations we will see that truly good product, you know the one with a built-in battery and the one that can last all day with no problems. We'll also see the software side fully utilized and we'll see app developers come on board whole hog and create engaging novel uses for the tech.

I mean just imagine three or four generations from now, we will see the promise of actual glasses style augmented reality, perhaps. Where you effectively get the same tech and user experience that you get with the current vision pro but it's in a traditional eyeglass form factor, which essentially means that it will have no detriment to the quality of life in terms of usability.

In some ways it's disheartening and disquieting to imagine this and it's successors and doppelgangers as our future, however I'm excited for the ride and excited for what comes next."

"Can I just express my concern for the skull deformation. I mean if the light pressure of a headset is enough to reshape a grown man’s head, what will be the impact for kids? Is it cool yes is it well thought out by far no. I definitely think there will be a lawsuit coming Apple’s way. If this technology is not quickly improved."
"Apple twisted itself into a pretzel trying to cram all the parts in the headset which makes it heavy. If there is going to be an external box (battery or whatever) they could have offloaded all the processing guts to the box and just have the display and sensors in the headset.

Secondly, they could have offered two versions of it.
1) That comes with the processing unit and the headset.
2) Just the headset and have the mac (laptop or mini) do the processing connected through a cable. This could be a less expensive option and probably be more powerful since it can use the computer for some heavy tasks.

This gives users options and makes the headset lighter."

They should make another one which is just an accessory to your phone with all the vr ar tech on the headset but all the power from the phone so it will be a lot lighter and thinner than it is now you carry your phone with you all the time anyway why strap extra weight on your head.

"FYI 7:59 In music, we now use software sythesizers in place of physical instruments. I personally find around 11ms (called latency in music / software syths) to be the cut-off at which it becomes physically noticeable that thee is a delay between me preesing a note and the sound starting to generate, ie the delay between physical action/reality and audio. So 12ms is probably only JUST there; v1

I currently run at 5ms latency"
Great review man. As always
I waited until gen 8 to get an Apple Watch.  I might grab one of these when it gets to Gen 3 or 4.

"Really cool i wonder if the day will come that we wear helmets. Filter the air we breath. The volume would be amazing . Noise cancelling headphones would be of the charts. It would look unique, but the technology would be amazing."
Me watching whilst never planning on buying this 👁️👄👁️
PUBG PLAY NOW BRO
It not having tiktok is a plus tbh.
Naaa
*READY PLAYER ONE*
I reckon people with end up making aftermarket headstraps like the quest series? Just need to wait a bit
I love how honest you are all the time! That’s a huge deal❤❤❤!!!
It would be cool if you could place a virtual tag on your car and then you get a big moving arrow that will point to the tag.
"The whole ""looking at the wall where the window SHOULD be"" happened with me when I watched Atlantis.  I was playing SO MUCH Windwaker that when an explosion happened in Atlantis, I looked at the remote and wondered WHY it didn't vibrate.  It's all about that trained feedback to your brain..."
You can't really call a feature iconic when it's the first gen model. They could absolutely ditch the goody bits of this device and clean it up for future adoption by more people.
Apple fan boy 😂 it's trash 🗑
I know you watched Porn on this thing but say nothing about that! 😂
Will check this video after 6 years in 2030 to see how much the technology will evolve over time.
"I hope soon, virtual assistants will become have their body instead just circle animation, just like Yui in SAO"
Shit. Matrix.
This Apple vision pro seems like a prototype which has been released without further development.
Also not glass. Its plastic :)
Thank you for the video. Do you like Meta Quest 3 better than Apple Vision Pro?
"If I can do my computer and phone work through it, I will buy. Maybe that's why Apple didn't produce with this capability because it would lose the market for Apple phones and computers"
Thanks for honesty 😊
"This is so wrong, I want to see people’s eyes."
"Zombie land, how you can like that?"
"On one hand: Apple usually doesn’t release things unless they are sure it will do well (or they somehow force it to do well).

On the other hand: Steve Jobs might have been the total genius of Apple, and this is not anything he would have supported or produced, so it could flop.

Steve talked about how the iPhone was sort of the natural progression of computers. No keyboard, portable, many high quality devices in one, etc. the iPad felt pretty natural as well. Simplicity of an iPhone, but bigger and more usable.

However, the Apple Vision Pro… is… ehh… kind of idk who was asking for this, or thought it was the next natural step."
I’ll just wait for the regular _Apple Vision_ instead of the _Pro_ version I don’t have the cash.
some people will die using this
"When I See Someone Using This Around, I Feel Like I'm In The Era of Cyberpunk That's Just Start, I Like Sci-fi So Much & This's Cool
The SAO Tech Will Come Soon Day by Day, It's Feel Like SAO Ordinal Scale Movie Where All The Gamer & Player Using This for Gaming"
wow
"Very cool
I'm not a fan of Apple, but this thing just gets me exited for what the future holds
Good work Apple, can't wait for an android verision of this thing lol"
"IT WILL BE TTHE ULTRA BEST BOEING 737 FLYING SIMULATOR !!!! 

Sorry for emphasizing. Actually I want to write is that vr is great for palworld. kthnxbye"
"I know this is a little weird, but I can tell that you’ve used the Vision Pro a lot by the difference in the color of your skin around your eyes😂. All cool though, happens to me too😂"
A link to the other vid would have been helpful. Great work tho! Appreciate ya!
did he mention the battery life?  with 1 full powerbank charge how long does it last ?
"12:30 - this will also a huge innovation for people who need a big screen in the field to work on things (construction, planning, etc.). As a battery powered autark working unit there are so many things possible now."
I tried it and damn was it impressive. The displays are beyond reality and gorgeous.
"This is a great weapon to have on the combat field in many ways!map pop ups, vitals compas etc. But as trails to the public we have to see the downside for using the product to long. as everyday people how would this product benifit besides checking emails calls etc. It's vital to pay attention because bloomer will be doing everything with them on."
Can it be downloaded from play store and does it use a mobile phone sim?
Why do people like me love to watch things they can't afford 😂😂
A minute into the video and im thinking about the HomePod 😂😂😂
to turn it off the Apple vision u have to click the digital button and shutter button like a iPhone for 5 sec
Why pay for a virtual reality when reality is free. Bonkers. Go hiking and see the real world.
"Timestamp 13:00  your reaction is totally understandable it's the same as being handed an oldtime cell phone to use  and even though you know it doesn't have a ""touch screen"" you still end up touching the screen occasionally to move or activate things"
It's so funny watching this and thinking how in the future the vision pro will look like how the original iPod looks to us now
IMO: it's protype 1 only... in future it will be a size of normal eye glasses or even a chip in brain
worst thing ive ever seen
"Ideally, shouldn't the AR tech of the future be literally transparent?"
do you NEED a mac to do that or can you just use a bluetooth keyboard?
"This is sooo expensive lol, especially considering the fact that it's relatively new tech and will probably be wayyy better in the next version, only a year or two from now"
I’m going to build the next app for one of these MR headsets that becomes as successful as WhatsApp 😢 and makes me a multimillionaire
What a fantastic review marques apple vision pro i like it its not my favorite but it has all the necessities that any ar/vr headset good sensors good strap and glld software but you and dave are absolutely right about the straps of the vr headsets apple nailed on the straps on the vision pro it looks a lot more luxurious than then its predecessors though the battery life is garbage in this crazy 3500 dollar price tag surely the second gen might have amazing battery life the best part i like about your usage on the vision pro is how you interact with everything that you can show us i love the split screens its lime ready player one overall its a product for those who are reall trying in the vr/ar world id love to see more companies jump in the vr competition now that apple has made one thanks for sharing your usage marques ❤❤❤
"So they didn't test it on darker skin tones? AND they aren't accessible to people with prescription lenses?!!!! Double Whammy. Do better, Apple."
"😂 No one knows about Mojo Vision... Mark isn't investing, Elon isn't investing. Don't they know whats coming?😂😂"
guess i'm a luddite now because everything about this creeps me out.
"I know people are working on It, but Yu-Gi-Oh like in the snime would be awesome"
bruh even this man dont know how tk turn if this. Non of big (fake ass) reviewers also dont know . Literally just press crown and shutter for 5 sec and it show same power off animeted slide same like iphones 😒
"So if it's not actually clear, and you're not actually looking through it, why the fuck is it glass? Why do they need to put glass on everything, unnecessarily? It's an $800 replacement because they put one big sheet of glass over the two cameras that you look through, which are behind it, meaning that every scratch, crack, chip, or ding, in that glass now cost you $800 because the cameras can't work properly. This is the dumbest fucking decision that Apple makes time and time again. Stop putting glass on shit that doesn't need it. Or, stop making it a several hundred dollar replacement, when it inevitably fucking breaks. How many iPhone users don't have a broke ass screen? Every fucking iPhone I see someone take out of their pocket, is either in a brick of a case, or is busted to shit."
Marques Brownlee is absolutely the very best at what he does...
"It's a shit, it's not like when they show it in their advertising"
I still don’t understand what this thing is meant to accomplish. Seems like a gadget looking for a purpose.
They need to fix camera shake
"Come on Apple.  That’s not only for inside use.   Why would I want to walk around with something that big and heavy on my face?   

Make it a glasses."
Could you please do a comparison between MICROSOFT HOLOLENSE 2 vs APPLE VISION PRO. Thank you sir.
The gates of hell opened. This really disgusts me.
"The first thing I though when I saw the VP is that it's a shame you can't share your experience, so agree that it is needed, however to say Meta Quest has sharing experience is a joke, that's not a shared experience I'm after.
Also iPhone integration and being able to answer calls like on the Mac & iPad is a must.
I haven't experienced it, because I'm in the UK, however it looks like field of vision needs improving.
The pass through camera's also need improvements, especially in low light
The big one for a lot of pro's would be controlling your Mac through VP.
But then again, did anyone expect it to be perfect?"
The reason why it's so uncomfortable is due to the pressure sitting right over some critical nerves - trochlear & supra-orbital nerves and the infra-orbital nerves. Pressure on these after a while are very uncomfortable.
"what i imagine is when everyone starting pulling out the “ apple vision 1nd gen” card, the people @  thinking this was it (for hardware) being like oh crap, we gotta start working on the next one"
"I still don't understand how with so many things you mention, you absolutely fail to mention the Microsoft Hololens which did those same things... 5 years ago. For a tech YouTuber I personally think you need to do a bit more research before putting it in a video. My request is to please take a look at the Hololens and compare features with the Vision Pro. Talk about the ups and downs of each platform and how they compare etc. I can't imagine you just magically forgot about it, even if it seems you're clearly a fan of Apple products."
Great review
"When Google glasses, that was disgusting our privacy, 
Apple vision pro : Awesome and Gorgeous"
So we just need the OASIS game from “Player One”
Steve Jobs would have never allowed to ship such crappy product. He would want the world to get mesmerized
Today's day dream...Tomorrow's nightmare.
"You know those VRMMO animes? Yeah those.... If Apple corners this market, the investment return will be huge.

I could probably pay 3k+ dollars to play a safe Sword Art Online 😅"
Everybody looks like Will Smith in Shark Tale hahahaha!
Paying almost $4000 for a quest 3 is crazy
What are the reasons for building an app for any of Apple's platforms including the Apple Vision Pro when they are taking 30% of the developer's revenue?
Are there any clinical studies on what this product does to your eyes?
"There is a game called Wrath 2 on Meta Quest 3 that will put you in the most insane VR Experience Ever! It’s unexplainable how immersive and crazy it is it will trigger everything you have in you literally fighting giants, gods and huge monsters.  The sounds and animations will literally blow you away, and yet Apple has a “vacuum cleaning” game and we call that “awesome”….because it’s Apple. It’s sad."
Try fly “a Drone” using Apple Vision pro ❤
We need a reset technology is ruining our lives and kids lives when was the last time you saw kids playing outside
Thank you but does apple offer dual apps on iOS ?
"I’m not agree with a picture quality, it’s not close to what you usually see, it’s like watching a video 720 P on 4K display. But again, it’s definitely depends on your eye, vision sharpness"
Exactly what I expected to watch 🙌 Thanks MB+Team.
"This will never happen… but please neuralink and apple combine forces and combine both things together, I want thoughts to become reality before my eyes"
Maybe when they are on the 5th generation and half the price. Not worth it at the current price.
Generation 2 : TWO PEOPLE SEE SAME THINGS ON DIFFERENT APPLES vision PRO!! 🫧🤿🪁
12:56  This is scarier than we think
Why does this dude have 10 videos on vision pro and almost non on quest 3
"Apple make anything, even a rock, 
MKBHD : I love this thing :D"
Can you please tell to apple that to attach a chatGPT with voice into vision pro like Jarvis
Imagine watching a 3d football game like in the field
Waiting for the Apple Vision iBalls
"the 3D projection, how big can you go ? Because if you can use it in an hangar it will be really useful. think about production/chemical plants"
Tech-neck to the millionth degree.
I wanted to know how good the speakers were. For watching movies and stuff
Do you know if I can drive wearing this?
What if you wear eyeglasses?
Oh like iron man
This thing has the same hype just like what the microsoft's hololens had back then in 2015. People are just too stupid.
"I can't help but compare with PS5's VR goggles. There are similarities. Single cable. Passthrough vision mode. And only where you look at is sharp, everything else is blurry.
And then I remember the price difference."
I waiting for other company for this Google and Samsung
There should be third party apps like Android it will become more interesting and widespread ecosystem and many developers for  it
How does this compare to Google Glasses spec for spec?
Does the Vision Pro work with air pods?
"Extremely superb, futuristic device. one of the best reviews done ❤.
However to me this gadget feels kinda useless. The tech is great but it is way too much."
Sponsored by Samsung
I'll wait for Gen X.
I watched this on my vision pro! Also there is a way to turn off the headset btw you hold the side button and crown for a few secs then slide to power off.
Just put a 360 camera on courtside and record it LIVE. And you can watch it like you're there.
Bruh ya all forgetting the biggest thing Nintendo and apple can drop the biggest POKÉMON game in history now .
I expect just universal VR-Desktop from such devices but not with such crap resolution like this one.
Phone addiction to the next level
Oo  future technology 😮
imagine being able to sit in the stands but you are at home and didn´t pay for the hotell and fly ticket. But just the game ticket. I am so sold for that idea since I live in Sweden and can´t afford and got the time to travel around seeing all the sport events or any events. Being able to watch my favorite team play like you are there in the sits must be an experience. Apple is showing the true potential and Samsung and the rest will follow suits
But this....this thing is interesting 👌🏼
"No way this is worth $4000. It may be the best, but it's not good enough. Many of the cons mentioned in your video have been cons in headsets for years. You're complaining about the same things I complained about years ago. I have Google cardboard, Samsung Gear, PSVR1, PSVR2, and Meta Quest 2. They've definitely gotten better (Sony did foveated rendering a year ago), but the truth is that the technology is simply not there yet to make headsets mainstream, and you don't need to spend $4000 to enjoy what VR tech has to offer. I think the Quest 2 is the sweet spot. It's functional and you'll get that wow feeling, but you won't regret buying it a week later."
"Hmh, M2 + Unreal Metahumans. Could be interesting :)"
So if I wear glasses irl I won’t have to wear them with this headset on or would I have to to be able to see properly
Just returned mine after 3 days of use. Super cool but still a toy and VERY uncomfortable.
"I can see where this technology is heading. Just thought it would be great for watching football (soccer), watching  my team Man Utd at Old Trafford and switching seat positions to follow the action or following the players on the pitch...mind blowing!  A few years away yet but I bet it gets there"
ultimate headache machine
I wonder how popular it will be to see or do things on your apple vision that you shouldnt be doing in public for fun and kicks. I can se so much excitement for that kind of activity
"So Marques you don't talk about how is this affect the privacy of other people as this thing in order to make you see the world it make you see it through its camera and who knows what apple special computing can do with this non stopable camera recording.
Don't u think so."
What happens if you stare at the sun with the Vision Pro?
TOO MUCH LITE in eyes = BLINDNESS so this one guy wore 50 hrs not taking VR off not good. Good Info: Copper Blocks WIFI -- USLOBBYISTLIED WORLD KNOWS; Rollens/SideWindowDeflectors/lowbluelightsVINYLORANGE; Eyejusters; GrissomBARON; ZPG1.5c; EARMUFFS. Dentists don't track X-Rays don't get MRIs.
"There is LITERALLY no point in buying this product, it really is NOTHING new and what’s more it does NOTHING more than your smartphone. I heard another reviewer say (something like) ""Vision Pro negates the need for me to buy a $5000 TV"". What he didn’t mention was that, for his whole family to watch the same movie (with Vision Pro) you’d be looking at a minimum of SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. Get real Apple, this thing’s a JOKE that’s being carried by its enormous hype machine. You know what I’m talkin about Marques, right?!…😉😉😉
Oh, and I’ve been an Apple fan/user for over 30 years."
Oh damn i thought they were transparent screens... So you're just looking at screens from a camera ?? 😂
I can’t wait for it to be contact lenses
Iphone is literally the WORST example of technology advancing 😂
Ready player one in real life
"Everythings find and dandy, but for 3500$ I dont need it that much!"
"didn't want to mention the crashing, blurriness, can't be used in a dark room, the pain on face after wearing for a few hours, red marks left on face. etc...? Odd."
"The F1 thing i see being a thing in the near future due to the ""multi viewer"" app that already is a thing they would just need to make this into a apple vision app and this would  be brilliant."
Imagine Apple Vision Pro with dyson zone headphones and custom visor if possible.
Recorded myself playing guitar with the Vision Pro. Check it out!
I'm telling my kids to become optometrists.
"While it might be true, I don't think the lack of apps is a reasonable criticism. What revolutionary new tech ever had full third party developer support?, upon the 1.0 version launch? Not the desktop PC. Not the smartphone. This is a PRO version released exactly so those developers can start to develop for it. You never once mention the target audience of the PRO: The friggin' people who will be writing said apps! This is not a consumer model so stop pretending it is."
Dear headset makers: I just want a helmet
Everything is good....Bt need little improvement.....😂😂
Fantastic review! Your exploration of the Apple Vision Pro showcases the intersection of futuristic ideas and cutting-edge technology. Insightful and engaging!
i think this is an incredible first step in an very interesting direction. So far this is just a fancy toy (as you said) but it's possibilites are insane. If i just get to play a game while dusting :D
"Hi Sir, thanks for this awesome indepth vid.  I am in Teams call all day.  Does MS Teams work on it?"
$3499 Apple Lost They Damn Mind🤣
Does it also adjust for weak eyesights
Do you have to wear glasses?
I am pretty sure the fuzziness of what you are not looking at directly is comlpetely intentional as oppose to being something due to the computer's power
This with normal glasses is future
Amazing review ❤well done bro you nailed it 👏 👍
"You can use it only as an iPhone/iPad. Clearly it will improve, but it's literally a computer like your phone, but you can't run desktop apps on it (maybe the overhead of rendering the 3d interface slows it down, but it's a computer)"
"You need, and only need, foveated rendering. it works perfectly."
"Simula VR is an interesting looking VR Linux computer that works like that with high resolution display, passthrough, and intel i7 mobile"
"What if… 'pro' stands for:
‚Prototype‘, like the shiny studies you see on any car-show? With features, never seen in the final version? And, the final customers version (‚Vision nano‘) comes with a stripped-off list of marvels… Just an idea.-"
"I think I'll just go n put a vinyl on my turnTable, sit down with a good old fashion book and drink a well brewd cup of coffee. I don't need all that crap."
"Oh well, car accidents are seriously guaranteed."
"Who do you think will pay the Apple overpriced goggles, not the average working man or woman. 3500 $$$ are you crazy."
Actually we don't need more AR or VR. WE need more reality driven people.
"If im going to pay 4k for that, ill wait for version 4.  At least wait for quality apps to catch up."
"No gaming ecosystem, blah, I'd rather own and use the Quest 3 - but I can see the Apple ecosystem being a strong argument for this for the non-gamers."
Why not spend those 4k on food and i dont know maybe a roof over your head. You do remmber you have eyes and can see the sun way waaaay better than a bunch of cameras right.
It’s a $3500 gimmick. It’s a niche item at best. It will never go mainstream.
the future is scary and exciting at the same time
"I would be worried about the radiation that thing is giving off to your brain - wearing it for such an extended period of time. Lookup research on radiation levels for talking on your phone against your ear, bluetooth earpieces vs talking on speaker phone. I would trust it for a sec."
This is going to be great when Apple releases the 2nd Gen and brags about how they made it more affordable at $999
Upcoming: Vision and Vision Max!😂
"When you asked: ""How do you look better in a coffee shop? With a notebook in front or with Vision on your head?""

My answer:""Definetely with the laptop in front. You look real, human, I can see your eyes and make eye contact"""
"Always love your videos and how well they are done. I have a question, I have a 13 pro max with 97% battery health in pristine condition. Should I upgrade to the 15 pro max now or wait for the 16 pro max ? Thank you so much !"
"I don’t think this is going to be the next iPhone, for Apple. I think it’s going to be the next Newton."
I hope there will be 3D versions of movies for the vision pro
"i think the vision pro actually changed everybody's perception of the future of Tech, as in its going to be integrated into the human and life, and not be a physical attachment to reach new things in life."
now u can play yugioh like the anime 😂
We are actually seeing the start of a technological revolution.
It’s called Vision ‘’Pro’’ right off the bet because everybody already has a Vision 😅
You made a very honest review 👏👏👏👏
"People really gonna be wearing this stuff all the time in the future, and us old people gonna be like ""In our time we used to have phones and stuff"""
"It’s cool for now, but my guess is Elon eventually passes it all up somehow with Neuralink replacing some of the use cases of phones/computers, plus having starlink to replace the need for communications companies, as their performance isn’t great anymore (my family’s phones on ATT is getting slower and less consistent)."
Can you pair it with AirPods Max?
Thanks @mkbhd did you and others use the Vision Pro in the same room? Are you able to see the same screens and work together on the same whiteboard for example?
"12:50 i choose neither.
18:12 - 19:57 the swimming goggles problem"
"Your conversation about the headband actually makes me curious if I could find some sort of a headband system for my Odyssey headset because it uses the same tightening system across the back with no real overhead band and there's so much that goes wrong in the first 30 minutes of usage just getting it comfy, not overly fogged up cause the seal isn't quite right ,etc."
Pair VisionPro like device with Transparent display built by Samsung/LG showcased at CES and you get best of both worlds
"NBA Courtside for VR has been around for at least 3 years already for the Quest, I had it for my Quest Go and watched a ton of court side before COVID. Its incredible, and you can change views from behind the backboard to court side etc!"
Quest 3 way better and a fraction of the price. That's a toy for rich people and a copy what other company's have fine for years. Nothing new
OK but imagine Google street view with your avatar or something 😂
"Damn, this just puts content consumption into a different kind of addiction level. Putting the phone down is such an essential thing to do now, but so challenging for most people. And this? Wtf bye bye actual human connection and creativity from boredom."
"common man, don't write ""the truth"", in the thumbnail, you are way too good for that"
Just tried this yesterday. The possibilities are endless. Environment is way better than immersive. Pair this with holotile= change the world. The fidelity of training in healthcare that can occur is wild.
Connect this staff with starlink. And general will have massive view on how war could be conducted. Certainly dangerous are they
Pleaaasssee... take a full moon shot in a clear night... let's see the true range of these cameras.
i really dont like all of those products. that makes it impossible to use it without a user account . i can not imagine how a computer mouse would only function with a user account.. there is no reasanable  reason for this behaviour...
"Peace, I hope, and us being wise enough to ward off dystopia"
“‘30-45’ minutes to have to this off “ - I think Apple might have designed that purposefully
It’s a fad like the other vr objects. This isn’t typical and it’s clunky.
"i'm from the future! , gen 2 will be cheaper and wireless!"
Behold!  the first residential cycborg !
we now know what its like to be a cycborg !  gen 2 will have Neuralink ! haha
"This is the most dangerous thing I have seen.... I fear about the future. Only the one who love family bonds understands what I mean. These things will destroy love, family bond and values. My God protect us."
What if were are looking through VR headset but its really advance that we don't know how to take it off
How people with glasses will wear this?
"Also one big pro for a native apple VR product is its compatibility for MacOS. There is no VR headset fully compatible e.g. running the flight simulator X-Plane on an Apple Silicon M2 Mac, today. Or am I wrong?"
"you all will need like +5 lenses on ur eyes, or all users of these headsets will be severly myopic due to accommodative spasm in no time"
The price is insane.
I use whatsapp
Idk why people complain about the price. Microsoft Hololens cost more than this and was a complete joke.
Didnt actually show anything
Imagine watching the Super bowl on these puppies. A tiny virtual field and your favorite players are running across your coffee table 😂
"As always, mkbhd liking apples boots. 😂
Its just a VR headset. I tried them and its just that, nothing more."
How much damage to the eyes?
What about capturing from cameras
Can't wait to use a future version for band rehearsal. Apple is going to eliminate the music stand business.
"The first iPhone, iPad, Watch all had definite deficiencies that eventually came later that were blatantly obvious.  What major deficiencies does the Vision Pro have other than Price, weight, battery range and lack of apps?  Apps will always come, that's what happens with ANY of these platforms.  Price?  Obviously, they aren't mfg millions, tens of millions or hundreds of millions of units to bring the price down.   Will Apple go to polycarbonate? I doubt it, they abandoned polycarbonate for all of their other products.  What could they possibly do to bring the price down other than mfg at scale?"
"I don’t plan on buying this but I was curious about your review and appreciate so much how honest, realistic, and relatable you are. You are the best tech reviewer of the internet and I thank you for helping us understand the newest things coming to the market ❤"
"i would love to see its use while i am operating on patients especially when I do laparoscopic surgeries.. already did a surgery using Google Glasses which was useful when I was teaching the residents .. especially in open surgeries when the residents can actually see which structures ""i"" am seeing while I am operating.. my radio friend and neurosurgery friend showed me its use for diagnosis & pinpointing the lesion in the brain in the real-time."
hey MKBHD do the Vision pro work with people who suffer from  astigmatism
"For me, this is the best product that Apple created. I know some people will tell that it looks stupid, but for me. No, this is something that I would love to have. We just had a new born and I would love to record the surrounding right now. And in the future, he will be able to see the surroundings and feel what its like to be when he was still a child. This device is so amazing for me. I wish I can have one too. Unfortunately, They don't offer this in the Philippines and I don't have money to buy it. But if you'll give it to me I would appreciate it so much. :D I love your contents. This review is amazing."
"I totally get that leaning negative towards apple products means you won't be invited to their events and won't be privy to a lot of exclusive stuff, but even by that line of reasoning...this is a bit much. The praises here lol"
Amongus
Imagine having a app that lets you have a nerf war for lack of a better word in your own home but 1000x as cool because instead of using a random nerf gun you found around the house you can use a machine gun.
LMAO that scene transition at the end with the apple vision pro was next level 😂😂
“There’s all this glass…” false. Jerryrigeverything proved it’s plastic.
"MKBHD, can you please compare it with Microsoft Holo Lens?"
I haven't seen Marques this excited for a piece of tech in a long time
I bet all futher developed apps (if there will be such) will be paid or will cost half the price of the device itself for subscriptions a month. Especially for an apple product.
"Push 2 buttons and hold to power off like normal then unplug it’s funny only one YouTuber figured it out the rest still didn’t figure it out yet  go to this you tuber get facts right 
UFD Tech o
@UFDTech • 838K subscribers • 3K videos"
Apple could easily use the cameras and AI to detect if the user is driving while using it and deactivate the vision pro
"I think instead to portray our eye with our image, Apple need to give an option to use emoji eye to portray our eye."
"You can turn off without removing the power cord 
Hold down the dial and the button for 5 seconds then slide to shutdown like on a iPhone"
they can make a normal glasses and adding an Ar to it
Can you safely look at the sun with this? How does it work at night for astronomy?
"Right now, it’s interesting, but not worth it at all for me (and most people)."
"It’s “interesting”, but it’s the first time I feel a bit disappointed watching 1h of your videos 😅"
Pined screens is nice to be coupled with GPS you could pin screens at any place in the world at real time or previously at home.
"I’m really excited to see this new platform develop and grow over time. I really want to see more shared experiences. If you bring two or more Vision Pro headsets together in a room, how do they interact? Can you share a giant movie theater together, or share a virtual tabletop game and environment? I know some of those things already exist on other platforms, so I know it will continue to grow now that Apple is in the game."
"I'm lowkey waiting for jailbreaking for my Vision Pro, lol. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love it so far.... but I have a few ideas that could make this thing way better that I think jailbreaking could accomplish that Apple would never approve of."
we don't want that world
"I think Xreal air 2 are better,

Are cheaper 

You can watch Netflix, YouTube easier 

Are smaller and lighter 

Maybe there’s a lot of things that are better the Apple Vision Pro, but I think that if if you think twice maybe you didn’t need that, you only need something that work well, that you can carry everywhere and easier. Sometimes less is more."

"They should make them redact ads for certain subjects like alcohol, tobacco gambling."
"I just showed my mom this video and she was so impressed by you and the quality of the video that she asked: ""Oh, so he's the developer of this device?"" So, for some people... you seem like a guy who casually invents the future of tech."
"You can do similar private video editing in a plane with any good headset and a virtual desktop, and a black sheet of paper or plastic over the laptop screen. Or lowering screen brightness to the minimum and almost closing it.  Or using screen extension with the one in the laptop being empty of running apps.  If your OS it does not simply allow you to turn it off completely, while still having the headset display on, through screen selection, etc..."
interesting. but that is just a virtual stuff. for those who fear living the real life world.
"This is very interesting tech. Also many possible applications for people with hearing impairement for example as someone speaks at the person, you could see a virtual person making sign language for example simultaneously."

"I am an apple user and have been for years, and to the people who hate on the vision pro heres what i gotta say.

VR as a whole is a gimmick, and is kinda dumb. The CONCEPT of VR is good, because it means convenience. However, currently, we just do not have to tech to make PROPER CONVENIENT VR. u guys know the Tony Stark Edith glasses? That is how VR would actually be beneficial. It would mean that the average human can just toss it on the whole day, and not have to have a phone, laptop, ipad, or anything. We probably wont be able to come up with that for at least another 100-200 years. Until then, in my opinion, all VR machines are stupid and completely a gimmick. GAMING is another talk, as i said, VR is a gimmick, and so if youre getting it for gaming, it is completely fair. Or watching movies, you are using a gimmick device to do ur hobbies, which is absolutely fair. But as of VR products for the next few decades or 100 years or so, they all suck.  Here is why they are gimmick:
1. Size
2.Battery life
3. Mediocre interactive experience
3. Price
All of those things are issues that VR and AR have now.
NOW, lets go to postive. THE ONE THING I APPLAUD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, IS APPLE FINALLY GETTING OFF THEIR ***. Im just happy that they are finally making new things (yes i know this product concept isnt new, but it is a new product in apples line).  The vision pro has many innovative features which is great, because it motivates the entire market to want to innovate as well. This is what we need in tech, we need companies to just not only make their base products, but to also TRY AND INNOVATE."
Did you get it for free?
"""I looked up on the wall to where the window would be ...""

Field of view and what people like and feel comfortable with varies with users. FPV googles have different camps who swear by larger or smaller FOV. I think that might need to be adjustable to accommodate people’s preference should it increase in the future.

Isn’t this dudes livelihood directly tied to our adoption of new technologies? Out of everyone discussing our future relationship with technology anyone with a profit motive ought to be discounted.

"If I could afford it, that field of view is THE NUMBER ONE REASON I wouldn't spend my money. And the fact that I've only seen Verge speak on it, was making me feel betrayed or misled. Your original review didn't mention it at all, and I would want to feel like you only end up doing this video because Verge revealed the truth in that regards, but I know these videos take time to be filmed and edited, so I believe you already had this in mind to speak on."

"Why don't they just make a helmet version of it or an accessory that looks like a helmet when vision pro is clipped in, so lesser weight or fatigue."
"Why did people absolutely hate the less intrusive, more practical, more normal looking Google Glass when they saw someone using it in public but the Apple Vision Pro is loved and called things like ""the future of computing"", ""visionary"", and, ""a status symbol"" when it's seen in public? I am seriously asking. Why is it okay to wear this Apple product in public but it was not okay to wear Google Glass in public?"
The post dubbing for that opening sequence is so well done? Left me dumbfounded lol
"On the weight, I think it's more about weight distribution on the head. 660g is very light.

s24.....
iPhone is the best looks so premium
why does everyone keep commenting on the mic its the same thing lmfao
When are colors changing when you zoom in on S24U and not changing on iPhone? from around 04:38 mark onwards.
Iphone 15❤
iPhone ❤
"I love Samsung (have S24u) but to be honest, the iPhone in most cases has better picture-quality, over the complete range. 24mp, 50mp, both look on iPhone better, more fine detail, less postprocessing, more natural look, even 200mp samsung is less detailed than 48mp iphone. But not the samsung sensors are bad, but the software processing it, if you take photos with gCam on samsung, the pictures are way better!  I hope for a very big update in samsungs camera software soon! (But I guess it will never happen). Oh, and video is on iPhone better in every case, too! iPhone does everything right, but I stick with android, because i Hate iOS ^^"
How do u find the cinematic mode on S24 Ultra ??
S24 ULTRA IS THE BEST!!
Tem momentos que o iPhone é  melhor e tem momentos  que a samsung é  melhor  e teve momentos  em que pareceu que a samsung  perdia o foco
i want best camera phone......which should i go for iphone 15 pro or s24 ultra or just wait for new launches of both the phones.....????
what we would get to see in s25 series and iphone 16 series......will there be any major changes in camera as compared to there previous ones...?????
9:01 - Samsung looks more neutral than iPhone here! 😂
"Samsung skin tone looks better, iPhone got him inside The Simpsons TV Show!  😂😂"
Samsung mic quality 🔥😱
Mic on s24 ultra is just insane 🔥
is this dude indian??
Reminds me supersaf camera style comparison
1:40 that proves you're a naive YouTuber. How on s24 ultra was that smooth lens switch. Comparisons means nitpicking fine details not describing their characteristics like parrots.
2:22 clear grain on the walls and the tv on the samsung in low light scenario...
"God these samsung air heads are freaking insane. Everyone is mentioning just 1 thing good of samsung. But didnt mention 1000 things better on iphone. I can only see the samsung just had better mic and an useless 100x zoom, which most people wont even zoom up to 20x. Rest things are just better on iphone. I am more surprised these sheeps dont talk about the superior camera quality of iphone. No one even dares to open their mouth of the inferior camera quality of iphone. The samsung had worst low light photos, blown out HDR, less details on every photos, typical oversaturation and overexposure, night mode looks like day time photos and raw photos are terrible. At 8:10 you said samsung had a natural look, whereas iphone clearly had better details and real crispy.
Also at 2:22 the samsung just blurred the lower portion of video especially at the painting whereas iphone had more details in the overall video. 
At 1:12 the samsung made a really artificial blur which alone makes it trash. Also not talking about the night video on 3:54
Your videos have been very biased to samsung since the release of s23 ultra. The only thing I have noticed smasung just wins in mic quality of video which is too heavily processed and doesnt sound natural. The greatest samsung air head award goes to you"
S24 ultra❤
"we know that when chef zaryab uploads a video, he'd be cooking like a pro 🔥🔥🍳"
everyone here talks about how good samsung when it comes to the mic. but not on the quality of the camera because we all know Apple is better.
Make another comparison
Samsung👌
Colors are way way better on the iphone
S24 night time video still so noise compared to 15 pro max
Качество ночной съёмки у iPhone лучше!
Why is Samsung having a jelly effect while shifting the lens
"Why the fck is everyone talking about microphone, this is camera comparision video."
"I'm at a loss, both are good phones, do you guys recommend taking a Samsung or an iPhone?"
I go wih S24Ultra.. Little better fast every shot
Overall the iPhone is way better and more balanced
the audio difference is nuts lol
"Bruh that iPhone mic 💀
Who bought these phones?"
"I have 23 ultra believe it cost me my relationship too my girl cannot hear traffic noise during calls and called me a liar for not going outside to pick her up and i told her about the noise cancellation and now she is mad because she said ""you can easily lie to me abou your whereabout because you have noise cancellation 😂"
24s❤🎉
S24U has such an awesome camera! Human Photography is next level like a cinematic camera! Too good!
2:02  Damm...iphone is really bad
"Pls improve night video and ultrawide night video in s24 ultra. 
That's why iphone is still the king of camera."
Best S24 Ultra camera It's good ❤❤🎉🎉
S24 Ultra 👏👏
samsung disgusting🤮
5-8 years away from competing with pro res cameras 📷
The 15 is outstanding
Galaxy s24 ultra overall beats the iphone 15 pro max i love the galaxys photos more than the iphone
"Да чё говорить, ультра красиво поимела айфон, редко чесный обзор увидиш👍"
@7:08 what lot of details? Samsung got so blurred
The sound quality on the S24 is way CRAZY 😮❤
S24 ultra anyday
"Although the iPhone's speakers are better, Samsung's audio always stands out"
I'm really bored nothing special every year the same phones
samsung video looks jittery when moving 5:44
"Hi i just got my s24 ultra, have you try whatsapp video call? I wonder why the quality is not as good as when we use the camera app, i mean i was using s22+ and i feel fine with the video call quality on s22+, while these s24ultra has worse quality? Its really worse for the flagship phone imho Or is it just my phone?"
Itu baru kamera 48MP bayangin jika Iphone pake 100 or 200MP😅
It is about the preference which u chooses❤❤❤. I personally love s24 ultra
S24 ultra 🪽🦈👌
S24 ultra ❤❤❤
Right now iphone has the best videos yet.. hope samsung lear the tricks apple does to get such better videos..
I wish they have a white color for S24 ☹️
Imagine after update on s24 ultra 😂
"Both devices are very nice, but I will definitely get the S24 Ultra because it suits me better and it has a great interface that is unmatched"
"After reading the comments, where most people are mentioning mic quality between the two. S24U has an automatic and aggressive noice cancelling, but it makes the voice unatural and thin due to isolation (it is still clear though), where as the iPhone kept both the voice and the environment noise intact (because he did not turn on noice cancellation. On 15PM the noice cancellation has a levels slider and on higher settings it erases almost all noice while still retaining most of the quality voice). 
It's made even more clear that at 2:17 when it's indoors, you can clearly hear that S24U keeps the clarity of the voice, but when you hear iPhone, it sounds like it has way more of the deep end and sounds more full like a professional studio condenser microphone, where the S24U albeit clear, sounds like a dynamic microphone where it has the high end, but almost non of the low end."
"guys .. should I swap my iPhone 13 Pro Max with S24 Ultra?
Yes or No? I don't enjoy iOS at all... maybe iPadOS only."
"Brother
Are you from johar town lahore??"
"Conclusion, phones are like politics. 
Mix them up and you'll get something amazing."
OSHOMAJOSEPH WAS HERE
"I much prefer the iPhone's more natural/realistic picture quality (you can bring it to your taste during post editing). And the sharprness is better all around, specially when shooting outdoors, the only excpetion being when you push the zoom to the maxumium. Not to mention that the Blackmagic camera app is available only for iOS and that can take video shooting to another level. However, it's impossible not to notice and mention how much better Samsung's mic is."
15 😎
So which one should I buy? Please recommend
the lamp is the enemy of Iphone
Are u from Pakistan?
"The one and only iphone killer is just a samsung, as specially S24 Ultra, unbeatable🔥"
Apple falling behind on more fronts
I see grate camera comparison video ❤
5:06 listen the music in background its sidhu moosewala 😂😂
In low light video performance definitely iphone is much better
Yov jk tamil nee enga inga
1:09 S24에서 동영상의 배경을 보면 좀 깜빡이는것 같은데 왜 그러는걸까요?
With that nose you’re clearly samsung fanboy 😂
Just can’t beat that iPhone video quality. 4k60 on an iPhone is insane! Drop in pro-res log 4k60 and it’s over and this is last year’s iPhone wait til the 2024 iPhone 16 Comes
S24u is all time king
"I have a question to people who have a Samsung S23 Ultra. Do you have a problem with strange noises coming from the lenses?  When I move the phone from side to side, I hear a strange ""flying"" sound, as if something had fallen off. Its so annoying. I wonder if the s24 Ultra also has this problem"
android fan but 15 pro is better
Overall I do prefer IPhone 15 pro
The iphone camera has warmer colors which is good because it wont make me look a lighter skin tone. That something that alwags bothered me about samsung phones. The white washing
"Hey bro, thanks for video! I like your Longines watch! Is that hydroconquest?"
I think the iphone settings have changed accidentally
Ithink thats not iphone
"I m Android user but , you cant compare any phone video quality with iPhone 👍"
"Obviously, the iPhone has better image quality and noise control in both photos and videos.
Also, Samsung’s colors seem to be very inaccurate? I'm not sure, but I think iPhone colors are more natural."
Iphone got spanked 😂😂
Samsumg ❤
been ios user for long time and currently using ip15 the basic one but we can't deny samsung S24 ultra is far way better than ip15 promax.
The s24 Ultra is disappointing. I'll stick with my s22 Ultra and Pixel 8.
Iphone better
bro made one of the best practical real life scenario camera comparison
"8:06 I'm sorry but how can you say the S24U has the natural and the iPhone the processed look? It's the exact opposite. The iPhone retains the small details and textures in the drawings and letters and paper, while the S24U completely AI smoothes the heck out of any detail. Up close the book would look like the iPhone, not the S24U. I don't understand why people think smoothing out noise and losing detail in the process is better. (I'm getting the S24U tomorrow btw, so I'm not an Apple fanboy)."
iphone pumps more yellow in
I love the right one
Just wait for major update on s24 ultra.
I have never been an apple fan but video quality of the iPhone 15pm is superior.. Mic on s24u is great too.
"I would also like to know if it is possible to switch to the 16:9 format in the 200mpx, 50mpx and 24mpx modes. Well thank you"
"The video at 2:20 compares shooting in low light. Here the iphone15 pro max has more details, a brighter image. On the S24U, the image is darker, smoother, not so sharp - detailed. Although a regulated FPS was used, the description says 4K60. I would like to see how it would turn out with a fixed setting of 4k30. Maybe just the same. According to this, the iPhone15 pro max is objectively better in terms of sensitivity.
I would also like to know if it is possible to switch to the 16:9 format in the 200mpx, 50mpx and 24mpx modes. Well thank you"
Mic is ok s24 ultra but iphone pics and videos so better that samsung
IP more orenge
tell me about that cap?
"iPhone, the king of video!"
❤s24 ultra ❤❤❤❤❤❤
iPhone gives extra skin tone but Samsung is natural.
That violet S24 Ultra looks so unique and elegant 💯
Samsung ❤
Thanks for the video! I dont think the S24 Ultra is good at shooting videos at night compraed to the Iphone. Iphone looks sharper in every situation!
For me s24ultra without having any update yet... Holds pretty well against iphone 15 pm.... Will see again with the update then
Микрофон на айфоне прям расстраивает..
how you improve your English?
Samsung con is the color processing.  Iphone does not drastically change colors when zooming. If comparing against android flagship same issue with samsung. But the mic no doubt is the best. Anyways i will still get s24u coz in my country the promo is still good.
King apple 🎉
Samsung will definitely improve after some software updates.
Good mic in Samsung. I love it.
S24 is sharper...color and contrast iphone actually looks better...audio samsung is better
Finally we see your face 😁😁
MashaAllah Zaryab Bhai aap ki sar pe topee bahut achi lag Rahi hai
ألوان ايفون افضل
"Your Voice looks similar ,identical like SQUALLY YT"
S24 ultra all the way.
s24 crap when low light
Both are really good phones
How does video recording pickup background noise? I have the s22u and my daughter's 11promax video records way cleaner sounds. Brought it to a concert and s22u video sound cracks. I also recorded my car's engine for hissing noise but samsung captures too many background noises while with iphone the hissing is very clear
"I just don’t like Samsung process the color of the picture it looks unnatural, Samsung stop processing the color of the pic, thats my only complaint!!"
Now I'm so hyped and can't wait for my s24 ultra to arrive
"100 % positive definitely getting the new S24 ultra 🎉🎉 switching from 14 pro max. can't wait, I did the prebooking already this apple products are boring trust me guys!! This whole ecosystem is just a gimmick"
cinematic video is the worsr on samsung
5:08 same beef by smw anyone noticed?
S24 ultra all the way
After 1 or 2 update samsung camera will leave behind iphone camera
Using 15 pro max but i think it's time to move on 24 Ultra 👏
S24 Nailed it
"O áudio do iphone é um pouco incômodo. Parece um som meio ""encaixotado' sei lá."
Copying everything from apple 😂
Very comprehensive comparison. Thanks alot
Yet again Samsung are bringing a phone that isn't even worth calling next gen.
"About colors... Don't forget, by default, samsung's colors are setting as""vivd""... To get the same colors as iphone 15 pro max, set it to ""natural""..."
Wow the iPhones colors are way better
apple better pick up the pace jesus xD
Are u from Pakistan
*crappple always beats samedung*
You are a SSheep
It is comparision like which one is better Lamborghini or Ferrari ?
How long does the Samsung S24 battery last?
Is amazing!! Good job 😊
Weird...this is my first time seeing your face 😂🎉
"Iphone is still rocking VIDEO, video on samsung, both night and cinematic ARE CRAP"
"Welcome back to Pakistan 😁 if you visit Islamabad let me know, I'd love to treat you out to a meal 😁"
Video quality is sharp in 🍎
Clown
Galaxy super 😊😊 bravoo
"Mic quality is quite a bit better on the samsung, but the lowlight performance and overall consistency when switching between the cameras is better on the iPhone but it still depends on the situation"
1:29- The change in voice quality is massive. Is the iPhone that bad or Samsung improved a lot
3x photo tint on the Samsung would be embarrassing for a phone even half the price.
disappointed in Samsung! I've S22U but the phone is pretty shit TBH....and iPhone 16 pro max will widen the gap even further....
"Hi, can you share the settings you used for the s24 Ultra? I loved them!❤"
Typical Samsung overblowing everything while iPhone takes natural photos. The Samsungs have improved in the last few years though
S24 ultra is best and amazing.
Samsung 100x better for iPhone
supersaf filter on this video🤪
Supposedly there will be a update for the s24 ultra soon that will improve the cameras . I think they purposely do things so they can be seen as on the job addressing software. It should have been ready to go at launch imo. As Ice has mentioned .
I love the s24 ULTRA ❤ 🥲🥲
A camera and performance update will come to the s24 series on the 23rd. I think that's when the testing should be done
oh man now I'm definitely go with iPhone  because Samsung so boost colour why and noise also
I still prefer the look of the pics on the 15pm honestly
Excellent video thanks
Samsung raped iPhone on selfies. 😏
There is not much difference. Both are good
Can s24u take moving pet pics?
Incredible how your result´s are different from other youtubers....
Samsung wins
"I'm Android user and I would never consider switching to Apple, however, it's sad that even Galaxy S24 Ultra cannot really catchup to iPhone when it comes to video quality. Except mic quality. 

Of course, it all depends on shooting conditions, but iPhone handles dynamic range better and it's more balanced overall."
ONEPLUS 12 ke Review karyin. ❤
Samsung is still running pre-release software 😂
Samsung > Iphone😂😂😂
Samsung ❤❤
"I love Samsung, but the iPhone's colors are more realistic thanks to the 3 nano processor"
I need  to wanna get xaomi 14pro  Would you please make a video for this by comparing with the xaomi
Both look good but to me the 15 pro max looks better
"Great to see these video's from you😊
The S24 Ultra is no doubt the best flagship of 2024!"
Samsung is stepping up its game 🔥
S24 ULTRA❤
Pixel 8 pro :😢
they just need to adjust hdr and lowlights exposure hope that happened in the next update
Amazing content and camera comprision as always bro
"I never used portrait mode on my S23 Ultra, the sensor and lens are so big you get real background blur anyway."
the intro reminded me of supersaf
"Everyone seeing the camera on Samsung is weaker than Iphone, so they only talking about the mic 🎤😭

Lets be honest, Iphone is killing it ❗️"
"When are these reviewers learn not everything is dynamic range, there is something called exposure."
Rip S24 ultra/ photographer.
Hello Brother. Please I would be happy if you answer. They say there is a problem with the front camera of the 15 pro max. Is this true? Blur and quality problem after photo taking?
Color production in night videography on the S24U is so superb
Skin tone S24 Ultra realistic
Everyone keeps talking about the mic prowess of the Samsung. Talk about the picture quality. The video. I'm not impressed!
"На Айфоне специально делают плохие микрофоны, чтобы людям ещё продавать нормальные микрофоны по ценам как крыло у самолёта."
Samsungs mic has improved alot they are close to beating apples
The dark recording section in the room when it came up against the lamp is spot on on the S24U 💯
I like Samsung's color profile a lot more than IPhone's
"Overall who is the best ?
iphone 15 pro max or Samsung s24U"
Das Foto ist Bashing….Niemals stinmt das
First time in years when samsung has an overall better camera
"The s24 ultra camera is not really that much improved and that is such a disappointment. I have the s21 ultra and I don't see a reason to upgrade. My initial thought was that I will upgrade this year,but nope.only samsung is happy with what they did."
Please do a social media camera test
the 5x is a massive difference for a 50mp difference
Literally iphone beats Samsung
Samsung is the King!
Im buying s24u!
i was wondering why the s24u look SOO much smoother untill i realized it can shoot 4k 120fps
Great video I ordered mine and will be reviewing it soon
"Why iPhone makes yellowish tone, is there any fault in iPhone"
Samsung is just great ❤️
"nahhh. i'll have to give 
it to samsung"
S24 ultra Night videography and mic quality is much better than iPhone.
Samsungs lit
S24 Ultra 👑
"Just ordered the S24 Ultra as successor of my Iphone11 Pro.

Very interesting comparison with really good scenes to see which devices handles those situations better.
Iphone seems to sharpen more and tends to have more contrast, at 2:30 for example it feels like the iphone does a better job at preserving the wall details, 2:40  goes to Samsung in my opinion.
At 9:06 I think the wheels look less warped on the iphone. 

S24's microphone seems insanely good, couldn't pinpoint when you were using your ""pro mic"" vs the s24, at least in the indoor scene."
"Both are good, a S24 is whipping the floor with the 15 Pro Max when it comes to mic quality"
Samsung can't be compared
Picture quality and microphone is way better on the Samsung S24 Ultra.
"right off the bat, the selfie video is THAT GOOD?"
S24 ultra destroys iPhone
Creator content gets a phone with not finished firmware 😉 samsung statement 😊
Oh bro which hat are you wearing ❤😊
Samsung boosts midtones too much in photos. Just lowering midtones and adding a bit of contrast will make it a point and shoot photography king.
IPhone sill has an edge over Samsung when it comes to regular not zoomed in videos. it also performs better in lowlight when no high dynamic range is required. But other than that the S24 Ultra takes the cake here.
iPhone taking photos of people make it more yellowish
"i must say that the photos of the samsung look more pleasing to watch. I cannot really explain why, but iphone images/videos look kinda unrealistic to me. As a Grafikdesigner i often work with sony and canoncameras, and the samsung gets the closest of what I experienced. Both are really good phones, i shouldnt complain :)"
S24 ultra has a natural quality
How much money did you get from Samsung for this video?
"Once again iphone can not be beaten, why is samsung focuses 80% on photos and only 20% on video ?"
"Los fanboys sois patéticos.  Es un camera test en el que el Iphone se mea en el S24, y todos los comentarios alabando el micro del Samsung 😂😂😂."
Айфон проиграл
Samsung so good looking camera😊😊😊
"Ok, yeah, Phone cameras still look like shit. Oversharpened with that ""HDR"" look and shit rolloff in the highlights. I would like to see how log recording might help here..."
wooow s24 ultra is destroying iphone 15 pro max
"Bro, are you from India?"
Not a iPhone fan but the camera I like better
"15 pro max is still better, more natural colors and clarity"
What's up sindhi boy😂😂
Saya rasa saya mulai mencintai iPhone
"15 pro max user here, can say s24 ultra is good. i wanna buy the basic model in the future."
The video quality on the Samsung looks like poop compared to the iPhone so much sharper and clearer on the iPhone.

"Iphone best camera, samsung best mic.🎉"
But s24 is not avlble in markt yed

Made w"
Iphone camera looks much better but s24's mic give better voice quality
The mic quality on s24 u just destroyed apple
"Realistically speaking, the cinematic video feature is dogshit on both"
Samsung is the best
Samsung takes the lead in most but at 0:41 the background video is too much shaking.
This is 1st time i see s24 ultra camera bettrer than iphone 15 pro max because other youtubers show s24 ultra camera is worst
apple always getting colors better dynamic nd deep
The era of Iphone is over~!!!!!!
S24 ultra is even much better than Iphone 15 pro max wow~~~~~~~~~~~~~
samsung sounds a whole lot better
"Man, the blur on the s24 ultra at the start of the video looks so natural, no one could catch if you told it was from a professional camera. (mostly)"
"Am I really the only one thinking that the sharpness and noise cancellations on the S24 is horrible? ... 
Not that Iphone is great, but you would love to have a bit of grain for natural feel when you zoom in, and as a video producer I don't care about the audio as I would most likely use external sound or at least lavalier in form of DJI Mics or similar... but the mics on both is mediocre.
The quality of the fake ""depth"" on the S24 is horrible compared to iPhone cause it seems as it is hunting the face and not stabilized at all on the person, again, it'll probably be better in the future, but I'd definitely take it away if I had any of these for video. 
Also the S24 when zooming in and changing every color settings and color science looks horrendous... just saying..."
But why your daily driver is iphone?
To me pretty much samsung was much better in everything.
S24 nailed it this time🎉
"Samsung is usually king on the HDR, butbik software updates will improve this camera setup"
"Can you do iPhone 15 (regular) vs. Galaxy S24 (regular), please?

9:21 If you can take 24MP RAW images, why not make it default? The processing is already there so it should be easy to implement."
Night times videos are better in iPhone otherwise most of the things are better in s24 ultra
Samsung did a great job with the new ultra
Tell me who uses cinematic video? It always looks horrible on any phone.
"I think Samsung needs to give the Ultra wide a bigger sensor next year and needs some colour consistency in the zoom, hopefully they can fix that. The colour temperature is totally different when you go into 3x and 5x"
iphone noticeably better in most scenarios
"in your tests the iphone completly destroys the s24u in terms of camera, except on the zoom. but damn that s24u mic is insanely good"
"I don't know what kind of monitor you're using, when comparing the footage, but the iPhone definitely doesn't have the more neutral look. The yellow-ish look on the iPhone is just weird. I'm surprised that people don't call Apple out for this."
I respect the fact that Apple keeps getting the colours right. If I want to boost colours of photos and videos for social media I can do it afterwards. Why ruin a good photo before? I’m an Android person but last year I got my first ever iPhone. I can’t wait to go back but I will miss the amazing camera of the iPhone. Their video is unparalleled.
"In the indoor night video Iphone 15pm just blowed the lamp , while the S24U had the best lamp rendition"
Exynos or snap
iPhone better
"You have to wait a Major update in s24 , It needs a camera fix"
God damn that crispiness on s24 mic is unbelievable
"That mic quality is godly on the s24.  The s24 video quality has improved a fair bit in the last 2 years.  Iphone won't be the default for video that ""just works"" any more and we have Samsung to thank for that"
Both the phone’s r beast.15pm user here.
"0:04 why Samsung shot looks so depressing?
iPhone is still the video king with no doubt."
"A very realistic comparison here! S24U pre ordered, iPhone not ordered 😊"
iphone❤
Samsung 0wned apple🗿
"we dont need so much tehnology, iphone 15 pro max rulz! bye bye samsung!"
Video quality and dynamic range is much better on s24 ultra
i really like the s24 ultra buut i preffer ios and the choise to not have a massive phone in my pocket please smsung make a s24 ultra in 6 inch or 6.1
"Damn iPhone 15 pro max smashing it 😮 I would say everything is better on iPhone except mic quality and zoom , although zoom is very close to be honest"
Till love iphone
"Congs to samsung🎉🎉🎉🎉
That audio quality is top notch😊"
s24는 망원렌즈로 가면 색온도가 변하네요.  이건 좀 아쉽네요.
"Colour science on iPhone cameras still better, Samsung tends to put a new good camera but doesn't give af about the colours"
"Samsung fun be like the sound samsung s24 ultra is great recording, Another reason 😂"
Bro are you Pashtun?? ❤
S24 undoubtedly 💗😘
S24 ultra is the best one.❤️‍🩹
The quality of samsung in videos is shit
Samsung adds  a blue tint in every nightime video
Samsung is catching up
The exposure changes on iPhone is very slow… That's why it's looks smooth when the scene changes from dark to bright or vice versa…
The Samsung looks fantastic on the very first clip
samsung features are best for wasted money
"AM 🇺🇸 
YISRAEL 🇮🇱 
CHAI 🔥

AMEN 🙏🏻 

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Is this after the software update on S24 Ultra ?
Very good job mate!!!!
Samsung Galaxy wins
"samsung white balance still sucks, no improvement at all. they should just buy the pixel camera app"
"The king 👑 is back on his throne.... Samsung really outdid themselves.
They not only improved the hardware, but also worked on their app optimization this time around and it really shows."
"The iphone looks better in most cases, the S24 has a flickering problem, and inside the house the s24 gets very unsharp compared to the iphone, for example look at the backround behind the tv here: 2:22"
Mic quality on S24u is soooo good. Feels like a separate high quality mic has been used. Samsung always had the best mic. It would've been nice if someone compared both speaker and mic quality in a controlled environment
"According to Samsung sample pictures, uou need one pound extra blood for healthy life.
An according to iPhone sample pictures, you have one pound extra blood than average human healthy body 😉😁"
3:55 again samsung lovers will say that samsung did better job in night videography at this time
I left the prepriatarry heavy Apple ecosystem about 10 years ago and I'm so glad and richer for it. Apple is still charging like Toyota for meh products and making a mockery of their customers.
The exposure shift on samsung is very bad 1:26
"I have 15pro max 

But galaxy is the best"
Another video where a youtuber says how good the s24 ultra is and then the next day they are using an iPhone again.   Sick of this s$#t
"I am a samsung user always have been,I have the s23 ultra but I feel the iPhone cameras colour in pictures is so much better maybe it just my eyes or what I prefer in a picture."
1:10 the sky from the trees in samsung is horrible
apple video king
Most of the people are talking about mic of samsung in the camera comparison video and why not about the better cameras of iPhone???
"I orderd the s 24 and i always had a samsung
...
But i have to say the iphone overal has more detail.. samsung seems to smooth to mutch mainly on night video, i also hate the blue sky on Samsung.

In real life situations both phones make the best photo's in the industrie"
Iphone je bio i ostao smecje
"Ok, samsung has really done something with the mic. I do not understand why they didnt tell us about it. Also, I didnt expect 15 pro lagging behind the s24U in videography."
S23 Ultra on ONEUI 6.0 Looks better than both of those. TRY IT YOU'll BE SHOCKED
S24 ultra ponovo vratio exynos proc
SAMSUNG ❤❤❤
My according Finally samsung🎉 achip I phone
I'm so disappointed on the camera section of s24 ultra tbh😢
Quality of photos/videos are great on both phones 🔥🔥
"Video iphn
Poto samsu"
"Man Samsung never nails the colors,they look unnatural"
S24ULTRA has upgraded the mic but the night videography is still pathetic.
"These two flagships are overhyped! Now, we can see Phones like Oppo Find X7Ultra and VivoX100pro are definitely equally good or better in some scenarios, but they're not often given deserving attention. Yes, their global availability may be the reason. And the Upcoming VivoX100ProPlus will eat these two phones in the camera department at ease!"
I love samsung ❤❤❤❤
"I love Samsung and will probably get this phone as my Pixel camera lens broke, but the camera quality looks a bit ass to be honest, the iphone is better here (both are horrible in video portrait, can't believe they released this unbaked feature). I expected more. The AI and other features look great and I'm looking forward to the S-Pen that I missed since Note 9."
iphone sucks in all aspects
8:08 No the iPhone looks way better here. Perfect sharp. The S24 has fake sharpness! Over sharpening!
"Everyone saying  about samsung mic, i remeber  my HTC  12+ could've  done the same 5-6 years ago, with with even better quality"
Even though this is a camera comparison. Feels like the mic on s24 ultra is a more stand out feature. Sounds so good.
"S24 is better on low lighting, but iphone edges a little bit on natural colors on well lit environments."
Am android user but recently switched on 15 pro max guys in real life seriously this phone is like a power in your hand camera is just superbbbb
"Wow, that light and lighting is beautiful in the s24 ultra 2:44"
"I had no idea there were so many people spreading such insanely biased reviews. I got the impression that Samsung is your personals preference. 

-- sent from my iPhone"
"S23 ultra is better than S24 ultra in night time.
S23 ultra had the same software feature ( changing framerate).
Iqoo 12 has the best night time video.
Even better details than iPhone 15"
The colors are so washed out with the S24!!
iphone clearly wins the comparison. Images taken from s24 ultra are more brighter even in night mode.
S24 Ultra is the overall camera king
"Ok so overall iphone wins that camera comparison, but it’s great that Samsung is so close."
the s24 ultras front facing camera is much better than the iphones
s24 kicks iphone out of the park.
So what phone will you use now?
unbias the samsung camera is wayyyy better considering everything. but the iphone is comparable when its in no zoom in bright day light its just preference there. overall samsung is like 20 times better
😀👍💕💕
OMG Samsung YESSS!❤
Is worth switching from s22 ultra to s24 ultra? I kinda want it when the price drops more
Camera Test: Samsung FANBOYS look how good the microphone is. 😂
"Задрали эквалайзером высокую частоту на Самсунге, так что посыпались сибилянты, а народ ведется))
И вырвиглазные цвета видео на Самсунг и перешарп, полная хрень! Глубины нет совсем в фотографиях! Единственное, что понравилось в s24 ultra - это зум!"
They're both great....the iPhone is somewhat warmer...buh they all need some improvement on the edge detection
I feel like Im drowning whenever you switch the mic to 15pro Mx and feel relief when you switch back to s24u
Hdr problem in s24u can be solved in software update 😀
"0:33 that switch to 2x with the Samsung looks rough. The background blur effect is glitchy. You can see the car on the back going in and out of portrait effect on Samsung and also the trees on the top at 1:09 it looks like Samsung is having a hard time while on the iPhone it looks seamless.
At 2:18 the details on the wall on Samsung video looks muddy.
At 3:49 the trees looks like painting on the Samsung side, there's no details.
4:54 Samsung suddenly decided to make the wall purple."
"Damn. This seems like the first real test. I've watched other camera comparisons and thought iPhone was better. But in this test, Samsung did better. Liking the S24Ultra. Thank you for this. 🙏🙏🙏"
S24 ultra has really beat iphone in almost all the criteria of being a good phone
Sry to say.. This time also 15 pro max better..❤
Wow iPhone is so much better.
Photo > s24 ultra video > iphone
At 2:52 the way samaung handled the light source was just excellent. It handeld the exposure pretty well. And felt like you were using a studio mike on the s24 ultra so good ❤
"I honestly don't know what to really expect
the other day I was seeing supersaf's comparison and in some cases Iphone appeared better, in some cases Samsung did"
Overall Samsung is batter ❤
iphone far better
Apple Log > Samsung
Surprisingly Samsung handle bright objects better than iphone in low light videos
"To be clear , the unit you used to shoot was the pre-production unit right? Won't the actual unit be better than that?"
Samsung really fucked iPhone now😂
still i think 15pro max camera is best else then zoom and some time in night  view
The pictures and video from SU 24 are horrible compared to IP 15 pro max on Supersaftv's channel. Nobody understands anything anymore. You just have to do the tests yourself.
The iPhone is so good. I think it's better than the S24 Ultra.
iPhone much better.  Samsung colors look like a horror film.
"Bro you are a sam fan boy,except your Battery Drain Test nowhere Samsung can beat Apple in Battery Test.Techdroider has also released a video yesterday where iPhone beats S24 Ultra in Battery  test."
🙌😌 All Hail Samsung.
😂S24 💩
S24 ultra needs some hdr updates.  Like even s23 ultra is better in hdr .
u look like a clown 💀
"With a little tuning and few updates, S24U will go so clear of iphone 15 Pro max"
Samsung  best❤
"Hi, bro! Your Pathan-Chitrali cap really makes you a handsome guy... A lot love from a Tribal Pathan from 🇵🇰... ❤❤❤"
iPHONE= BETTER CAMERA
Foreign anirudh photo copy😂
I ordered a Samsung S24 ultra. Microphone in this video awesome! Lowlight content IPhone definitely has the overhand! Probably will be better over time with the S24 ultra with updates. They both are great phones. Its about taste and preference.
"Samsung said they will release an update on 23th january, this is prerelease software. Why you are not waiting"
Exynos 2400 in war thunder 🗿
omg samsung❤
I just switched from iPhone 14 pro max to samsung s23 ultra. No regrets Samsung is amazing.
What is wrong in supersaf's  s24 ultra 😂😂
Are you from Kashmir 😅..
"Comparison between S23 Ultra vs S24 Ultra, eagerly waiting."
i think in every thing samsung beats the 15 pro max its far better
Can anyone explain why on the trees leaves (at the beginning of the video) the Samsung looks like blinking/shaking compared to the iPhone?
in video iphone is good when u zoom samsung wins their and also mic quality too
In chitrali topi you looks like ice  cream 🍦 😋 where you get this topi
Go and see super saf Samsung Galaxy s24 ultra vs iPhone 15 pro max camera review . In his  video you can Samsung camera is bad any why
02:26 watch and thank me later..only for legends😂😅
02:26 watch and thank me later..only for legends😂😅
"At 9:20, how is the 24MP expert raw shot better than the 12MP shot? 12MP shot looks so much better and has more detail to me"
Night selfies of s24 ultra 😩 just damn good
"What a great and practical comparison of both phones. Well done, mate 👏"
Still I phone is more vivid
Chill guys the camera of s24 will get updated
So you are in Pakistan hmmm 🤔🧐
"Hmm. I don't like the skin tones I've seen gotten out of the S24 Ultra which is peculiar. Something about the iPhone looks more natural where Samsung makes skin tones look a little green to me. 

I don't know if that's just a me thing"
iphones will never get the skin tones right. it will always make you look like a tomato.
camera quality still iphone is better
iPhone is as always Best ❤
"Even in low light video samsung is able to manage the luminous object better iphone  just overexposed such object.
Overall, I prefer samsung's camera it more  balance n  capable!"
MashaAllah brother your english is so good that i was thinking you are american ❤️👍
Samsung is the King now 🤴❤
Can u provide the link for that batman wallpaper please
nothing beats iphone
Looking good in that Pashtoon pakol
Samsung wins videos for me.. even at night.. the iphone has more details but less colours and lower hdr.. all personal preference tbf.
The iPhone is too red with face tones.
This time Samsung naild❤❤
Best comparison....
The quality of mic on s24 ultra is great
I phone 15pro max is so much better than s24 ultra 😂
Samsung has added another secondary noise cancelation mic on the s24U. Now it has two noise cancelation mic. And you can easily tell the improvement on s24U mic
"1 Не понимаю. На samsung ведь нельзя переключать объективы во время съёмки 60 кадров
2 пятикратный зум на samsung показался лучше.
3 hdr на samsung спраляется лучше (видно в помещении на лампе засвет iphone)
4 в первые вижу, что на samsung меньше шумов на фото, чем на любом другом смартфоне (огромный плюс для меня)
5 портреты людей на iphone днем более живые 
6 кино режим - огромная разница (в пользу iphone)
7 не увидел улучшений в трёхкратный увеличении на samsung по сравнению с прошлым годом, это печально
8 селфи больше понравилось на samsung 
В целом, конечно, хорошая работа над ошибками от samsung. Хотелось бы сравнить с vivi x100, oppo и huawei фотографии, конечно (по видео и так все понятно 😂)
Всё выше перечисленное, это моё мнение !"
Well as always when it comes to finding the better camera it always depends on your personal preference! lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Filter USE
The pixel 8 pro isn't even an option
Let's wait for the update and then we can actually compare😉
Iphone's video quality is better. But microphone of S24U is better
I phone video are 3 year a head of Samsung 😅😅
In this comparison s24 fukinly seems better 😂
Always Samsung ❤
"People criticize iPhone when it has one bad features.
People appreciating Samsung which only has one good features 😂"
s24U is ridicoulus
Good job sir
Your voice and the way you speak is really has great accent.❤
Video's still goes to iphone 😅
"iPhone 15 Pro user here. Samsung and iPhone are great camera phones and also the best on the market, if I wasn't an iPhone user, then definitely Samsung out of all Androids"
S24 is much better than 15pro
Are you Pathan ha 😂❤❤love your videos man ❤❤
Samsung's video encoding still gives nasty YouTube compression vibes. Great comparison!
"Both are the best phones, but I choose iPhone over the s24 ultra"
"Im user iPhone 15promax, honestly S24 Ultra video is better than iPhone"
Deep fusion still rocking.. texture maintenance is of next level on iPhone
2:42 amazing
"Left is normal lighting, right is last of us part 2 remastered (it seems to darken when zoomed out)"
In ultra you look like a dead man 😂
Guys lets be honest. Samsung still sucks at videos and pics. Esp at low light scenarios
Recordemos que samsung seguro va pulir sus camaras con alguna actualizacion
Iphone still king for making videos and pics
Im a 20 yr samsung user but gotta be honest they still don't have Apple in the video department. Samsung looked a tad better at times indoor with the low light situation
I'm surprised most folks are just now realizing that the mic quality on Samsung flagships have been noticably superior to iPhones since the Note 10 plus. That's when Samsung upped their audio quality.
S24u is insane man
"Im a fan of samsung, but that night video was struggling. The mic is amazing, im wearing headphones too, samsung sounds close and apple sounds muffled."
S24 ultra ❤
"I feel Iphone wins, video footages and images are super clear, while Samsung feels like a thin white fog layer on it"
just a small difference.. both are good phones
"Best review. 
Thanks for putting a lot of effort for viewers like me who will never buy any of these phones."
Video quality of iPhone is better
IPhone is still cleaner and true colors
I have seen some colour inconsistency in the s24 ultra.......
Actually s24u beat iphone 15 pro
The Samsung doesn't really perform a significant amount better than the iPhone. The upgrades have gotten so incremental now it's pointless releasing a new phone every year. Only Huawei had major upgrades that felt like they were so far ahead. Without Huawei it seems Samsung and Apple have become complacent.
They both are good
Waiting on iPhone 16 Pro Max 8 more months to go~~
This is what you call real review
Что с этим samsung творится?😢 мой samsung note 10+  фото лучше чем у s20ultra
so basically they both have great cameras and if you like iOS get an iPhone and if you like android get the Samsung
where is pixel 8pro❤❤
can t believ i have to admit samsung is finally better than the ip
S24 mic. iPhone everything else 🥹🥲
"finally, that zoomed low light shots on ths samsung has now greatly improved. Paired a with huge discount when i trade in my s23U, its worth it at best  plus I get to keep an upgraded non reflective screen which should improve viewing experience."
"When it comes to zoom, the quality on samsung is miles better. But on normal, the iphone looks better. I wish theres a phone that is best of both worlds 😂"
All these comments re mic quality. For many many years I haven’t heard of any mic issues with the iPhones. My iphone 15 pro max has outstanding audio and mic quality. What i do notice is zooming quality. Buttery smooth on the iPhone were as the Samsung has improved but still jerky.
Wow ! New video king?
To me Samsung took it all now
S2r actually separates better
The sound quality is better in S24 while the video and photo quality is still best at iPhone.
Bro how do you have that Pakhtun cap?btw awesome vid❤
S24’s camera improvement software update is still pending while iphone has received its updates to optimise the camera. S24 is already beating iphone what will be the result after its camera updates😂
"Except for super saf and Mr.whose the boss's camera sample reviews ,in everyone's reviews s24 ultra does better than iphone 15 pro max it's weird 
How is that possible?"
iphone wins video again.. i wonder how long it takes for samsung to catch up
S24 Ultra ❤
"video on the iPhone is much better than the s24u. but the microphone on the s24u is much better than the iPhone. overall, iPhone is still the king of smartphone videography but samsung is closely catching up. good job samsung."
"CANT F*N wait to get it ..i pre-ordered  unlocked ORANGE color /1 TB.. was alots discounts & Promotions & also got top  dollar for my Note 20 Ultra trade in ...LOOVE Samsung   F*** APPLE ..they don't give u even a D** to sit on greedy mother fathers  & they always few steps behind the Samsung  comes to Technology , I'm buying Note phones & Samsung tabs an all  since 2012 NEVER look to another .. they always kicking ass every year , as u show it in here  to me S24 ULTRA is more natural color comes to face & skin , that Iphone is to blown out"
Video quality in iphone is so good
"I feel like the ending of this video has truly come to pass in some sense. Just like how the PT Cruiser became commonplace, I feel like the same has happened with the CT, but even worse. In my city, so many of them are owned by commercial businesses that wrap the entire vehicle in an ad for the company. It’ll be for roof repair companies, a law office, or something else. It works in part because the truck draws attention, but kind of weird to see what seemed like such a novelty become a vehicle (literally and figuratively) for advertising."
It looks like something  6th grader designed.  Absolutely ridiculous.
Bloody nightmare 😂
"Funny to stumble upon this video a year after it was posted, have sponsorblock give a giant exclusive access warning and have the comments filled with Musk simps and gaslighting. Really demonstrates what kind of person the cybertruck was targetted at.

I would offer my condolences to every sucker who bought a cybertruck but everyone who paid money for this scam deserves what they got. Instead, I'll offer my condolences to every person who got harmed because of the people who fell for this scam."
"Iconic, yes, but not for the reasons MKBHD predicted it to be."
I have a cyber tuck
"I would want a Cybertruck, but i want to be able to do truck stuff, hauling trailers, cattle, tools and equipment. Even off roading to an extent. So I'm watching carefully until the truck is able to do truck stuff as it's titled as a 'Cybertruck.' I have a hobby farm so having this thing and being able to do what i normally do with my trucks here would be great."
"Did you mention the features of having glued-on metal plates that can fall off and have 120 volts to ground when charging? What about the hidden headlights that can get easily blocked by ice, snow, or dirt? Or perhaps the fact that it has worse maneuverability than an F150 at a higher cost, such that it can easily get stuck in snowier areas?

Not to mention anything about where the profits from the truck go..."
invincible against soft target like a pedestrian
What a piece of junk. Used cybertrucks are going for $39k. A pretty serious drop.
"aged liked milk. i want this, everyone who reviews stuff from stock companies just disclose how much stocks u hold. this dickriding of the fire trap truck is unbelievable. the most bad thing is that ppl look, my ass."
"I Agree with the Most Dangerous thing about Using A Cybertruck But Hey, Atleast It draws a lot of attention to you and I think Its Ugly And Awesome at the same time"
"Hated the design when it came out, now i think its kinda cool and unique.. Electric vehicles don't need to follow the same rules as traditional cars. They should be as creative and innovative as possible."
"It reminds me of the cars boys drew in the early 1980s.  Yeah, Musk is in his 50s like me.  It makes total sense. Ridiculous vehicle"
Based on your body movements I think you mean roll and pitch.
By far the best review I've seen so far. Thankyou
I saw a Cybertruck in the Home Depot parking lot last night. It was one of the worst looking vehicles I've ever seen in person.
"My God... Elon Musk pulled one of the biggest pranks in history with this UGLY-ass car!  He bamboozled people into thinking this is an edgy look into the future and some people literally bought into it. The truck may have a few cool features but it's an overall Shit-show.. And did I mention that it FUGLY?!. Yikes, next.."
Really? The most dangerous thing is the way it makes other people pn the road behave? That's more dangerous than how it has a tendency to catch on fire after a crash and drivers and passengers can be trapped inside while it's on fire?
when does the ***Führer makes the modell SS?
is the audio synced right in this video?
I see them on the road all the time these days. Obviously they're not common but they do stand out whenever I see one. I think they're an eyesore and i question the judgement of people who choose to buy one. Not to mention they're now being vandalized or violently destroyed by people as a political statement.
"Too bad that because of Elon's antics, all Teslas lost most of their resale value...and they are now being called ""Swasticars""."
I question the statement about profitable from the fundamentals of the company itself. My statement has nothing to do with Elon himself.
I also dont know if its beautiful or not.
Of course a tech bro would like this crap.
"Marques, why are you so forgiving of Tesla? No company produces this level of shoddy manufactured products and is so forgiving for inefficient mediocre workmanship."
"If you can't decide if the cyber truck is aesthetically pleasing to your eyes, at this age, you're either going blind or not as smart as you think; Marques."
2025 here... ironic is a better fit than iconic!
This take is loaded with Irony in 2025😅
Dumpster. That's the right name for it.
I think the ratio of joy-disgust has completely reversed from 80-20 when this video was released.
Car designers over the years have produced some real works of beauty. This Tesla is not one of them.
Very bold.
This video is a complete waste of time. I wanted to see the inside of the truck review.🙄
This one didn't age well either.
Nothing about this has aged well. More recalls than any other dumpster in history. Even the lambo goes faster.
The swasticar that turned into a meme
The 2025 Scratch N Go Tesla is the most popular model to date!  😂
"Screw the truck, I never been through neighborhoods like that 😂"
Iconic...in the sense that it's one of the worst cars (if you can call it a car) that I've ever seen. Thank god you can't buy them in my country.
this is literally a tv episode
that intro monologue actually aged well
"at this point i have to admit that this is an extremely iconic design, like the coke bottle"
iconic of being shite

“Most of the millions of people, who will end up with these—cybertrucks.” Bought for and paid by Tesla. Can someone spell fanboy infomercials?"
Time to go bald bro 😂😂😂
I love this truck! Now I actually have a solid reasons— other than thinking it looks cool.  Thanks for an excellent review.
"saw it in person today, its no bigger than a ford ranger raptor, or a toyota fortuna..."
"If/when Tesla goes bankrupt, will this car become a brick on wheels?"
"When you get hit you will not be fine. The way cars deform on impact is an energy absorption design, to avoid the energy of the impact to be totally transferred to the occupants. Unless the cybertruck deals with it some other way, it's way less safe because of that rigidity."
"Already iconic? Maybe as an icon of unique aesthetic and quick depreciation . 

Already past its peak of popularity? Kind of looks like it now, sales have declined considerably. 46,000 total sold as of March 2025. I don't think you'll be seeing millions of these on the road, ever.

There's not enough chumps with that kind of money to throw away. There's already surplus inventory of the 2024s gathering dust as we speak. Even when the price bottoms out around 65K, these will probably be going begging on the marketplace."
Great video bro
"2 rules: 

1). If you don't like the Cybertruck, don't buy one. 
2). If you have to go out of your way to hate on it, get a life."
Yeah i guess if everyone in the world wants to light one on fire or piss on it that does kinda make it iconic
A year later and CyberTrucks are “delaminating” and 8 recalls. It certainly will be iconic but for the wrong reasons.
"I have never been a sheep/follower, so im not going to talk smack about the Cyber truck. If i could afford it id buy 2 and i hate electric cars."
Blue hoodie guy never owned a real truck.
Omly a ifiot would buy that over priced crap.why praise it?
"""Already Iconic"" Cybertruck is being recalled across America? 

""Already Iconic"" Cybertruck is being recalled across America?

10 months ago you came down hard on Fisker, whose manufacturer makes G Wagons and you said ""shitty build quality"" - yikes."
"Fugly!

Best reviewer period."
Total Recall
This is an awesome video. I love the look of these cybertrucks.
"Yeah, definitely iconic for being the shittiest truck ever built lol. So many quality control issues being identified over the last few months"
Can in haul a 4 X 8 sheet of drywall?
Looks like a demo of making metallic boxes.
As iconic as tesla's shares tanking. Keep not talking about important things and suck up to big companies....
video delete button —->
"Well,  this did not age too well. My ""COOL"" neighbor could not get rid of it fast enough after only 8 months..LMAO "
"Dont like the front of that thing, its too short  compared to the back, looks ugly and weird"
foreigners finally catching up on fortuner !
These things are practically a scam. The sheer number of problems these things have with basic vehicle function is staggering. Also notable that Marques has already sold his. Yikes.
"Uhhh, “iconic” is not the “onic” word that applies here."
"Really enjoyed this video.  Marques is really smooth.

Never have had a real interest in an EV but now I think I will test drive a cyber truck."
STATUS SYMBOL - Pure and Simple
Cybertruck are not good on the snow .
❤️❤️❤️
😊
Swastitruck
I would say it's so ugly
Looks 💩.
this video didnt age well
"The ugliest car in the world. Covering it with swatika's is just an effort to improve the ""car""."
"I suggest a renderer, like V-ray. The car lines were very obtuse in the video."
LOVE IS LOVE 🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍⚧️☮️🩷
"The only made in america, that can match to Luxury cars from europe"
"Crap car, looks stupid, no good."
Sure Tesla makes a profit on every vehicle because their overhyped crap is hideously overpriced. Tesla is despised. If you buy a Tesla get ready to be stuck with it.
"It's an overhyped piece of crap. If you buy one, get ready to be stuck with it!"
13:55 give me chills 🥶
Intro is A1
Elon Musk REALLY REALLY REALLY needs to hire better designers for his vehicles.
Please stop making expensive crap iconic!
"What a Difference a ""year"" makes ! Tesla Stock is Sinking & CYBERTRUCKS are being Set on Fire.... Thank ELON."
Love that opening statement. Go Elon ❤❤
no iconic anymore
This represt the FUTUR🌏🚅🕔😎
"Iconic as in the biggest automotive disaster in history, it makes a Ford Edsel look like a practical car."
Biggest peice of useless crap on the road. Tesla vehicles are crap.
I wouldn't mind it so much IF IT WAS PAINTED.
i remember when elon use to be likeable
They forgot to add textures and pixals to their car
Was the head designer for the cybertruck Homer J Simpson?    😅
Almost as Iconic as USSR
The most dangerous thing about the Tesla Dumptruck is the idiot driving it.
Master Marquies cannot say that the cybertruck sucks ass lolz
Cool but the idea was stolen from James Cameron in aliens
You would think that they would take it out of the box first!  haha
So how much does it cost when it's time to replace the batteries.
The truck is very ugly
Variety reduces anxiety
The word is moronic.
If they made a smaller SUV or coupe using similar styling cues it would sell in huge numbers. There are elements of the design that are very cool.
"I will say to be honest I hated the design and think it’s so stupid. But now it’s kinda growing on me and after seeing its features kinda cool 

BUT my opinion still is not the “cyber truck is a real truck to do real truck things” I seen videos they do “EXTREME” things and it’s mild at best then an actual capable truck. Also build quality compared to like a Chevy and ford seems worst. To be fair this is like 1 gen issues like I remember watching a video of the front bar for the wheels broke and did the 👉👈 look so yes it’s nice for a road car but anything more I’m concern lol

Edit: alright I got to admit something else too. Most tucks are not doing truck things. They are on the road 1000% agree and if those who need a truck to do truck things I think most of the time they will be using stronger trucks like 250-350 in fords and chevys numbering scheme. Vs a normal 150 or 1500 I will say though I want it be good in off road conditions which. I think the cyber truck can manage especially for the ground clearance I just wonder on worst conditions like mud, slopes, getting out from being stuck, stuff like that."
Elon is so full of shit its actually impressive
why does everyone say this is an ugly truck?
"These Cyber Cans 🥫🥫🥫👽👽🫨 ""Can't ""  🤔😎🫨"
HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE TRUCK BLACK PEOPLE STAY AWAY
Could Musk Tesla OS and Warp operation systems be targeted with malware of a Stuxnet (target specific) design or is Elon proprietary units too smart for all the black-hatters of the world and deemed Mr untouchable.
hmmmm
"It’s already iconic, it’s the worst, most dangerous, most pedestrian unfriendly, most driver unfriendly vehicle ever built."
"I think there was a Infiniti car in like 2013 or 14 that had full steer-by-wire so no, Tesla deffinitely are not the first to do this."
Stupid truck.  Not a penny for Elon
Cool car 🚗
I m so sorry . It s so ugly
most people calling cyber truck  spaceship...
Where do the license plates go?
They’re actually gonna make a truck a regular truck. I’m excited for that one not this.
"The bulletproof glass shouldve been listed as a hazard, this car just sucks. It looks like a joke"
lmao its a swasticar now
Tesla ? Nope 👎
These thing look great at distance  . Guy has here in town up close its a piece of SHIT . The door panels look like someone hung a piece of plywood on the poorly I might add . And it like a Hummer too wide . In real life I don't why anyone would buy one .
please stop making reviews about Tesla…its just an another EV from an crazy idiot he thinks is revolutionair…🤢NOT…
It's Honest to It's na CYBERTRUCK a Truck that is only useful for the Cyber Space In Real World: Overhype Accessory Wanna Be Truck. UseLess. Good for blogging though. Minimalism= Paying more for less. Probable buyer = Influencers
This is exactly the information I have been looking for . Finally a great tutorial. I'm very interested in buying a cyber truck. Thank you for breaking it. Down.
Wonder how Marques feels about the Swasticar now....
Worst review
So if there's a shortcurcuit you will have zero control over your vehicle. Great.
This is NOT the vehicle I imagined the future would bring
Looks like Tin can 😅
Garbage
"اچھی ویڈیو، Pakwheels ۔ 
لیکن ہمارے پاس اصل سائبر ٹرک کا اردو جائزہ ہے۔
 سلام، 
Car Qabila"
Okey! But have you seen the Car Qabila review of the Tesla Cyber Truck?
Same as garbage truck in yugoslavia 1973
"With all the beautiful features you are talking about, you can as well give it a beautiful look, this thing is very ugly man"
"What, other than cheapness, is Tesla's fascination with deleting convention turn signal control stalks, which have been universally standard equipment on cars and trucks since the 1930s?"
It's just plain ugly. Like they ran out of design ideas.
9 months later and everyone’s bored by it now!
Douche mobile!
"To fix it they need to double the battery at all costs. Save money by dumping the stainless steel, steer by wire,  4 wheel steering, make the bed functional in size and shape,and add retractable running boards rather than the elevator ride."
"I wanted one like no other vehicle, but I passed on it. It offers something for everybody.  Most of it is not for me."
It’s absolutely horrific
It looks like garbage tunk they should modify and use it for picking garbage...
Being iconic requires it to be a proud product of the maker. These things are a joke. They are only legalised to be on the road in the US due to Musky paying millions to whoever signed it off as being safe. They are banned in the rest of the world due to the likely serious pedestrian injuries they would cause in a crash! And they look best a Hot Wheels toy.
Eye catching Eyesore! ☘️
"24:23 -- it's not the truck, its you marques. They are liking and disliking you out in the real world. 😅"
So ugly compared to other Tesla models. It looks like 60s Soviet brutalist architecture on wheels. It would look perfect parked in front of a dilapidated apartment in Vladivostok.
26:48
0:00
We all admit its most  horrible and ugly design ever made in human history
Wow. You are genius. Love this review.
Its just a box on the roads
"Already outdated.  Already declining sales. AMC Pacer and Gremlin are icons. Plymouth Duster. I suppose Cybertruck qualifies. Edit: I just thought of the case for you: Lamborghini Countach .  If you ever see one up close, sit n one, or drive one you realize what a terrible design and useless POS it is compared to other supercars. But it serves the same purpose as the Cybertruck: Adolescent boys and over the hill rich men both think it makes them special Well, OK, :""special"". To be fair, Cycbetruck probably works better in some respects, but it is already dated, and in decline because it is an over-priced boat anchor of a working truck and just wretched excess. Just my opinion. Your milage may vary."
Bro.that truck is ugly as hell! I've seen it in.the parking id be ashamed to own it.
How much were you pay to do this?
"Hey Marquise, when can I get the sweatshirt with the number 24. Nice shirt , please let me know."
"If you leave it at the right spot, John Connor will send somebody back in time to pick it up to use as a decoy so the machines maybe dont blow up his comrades."
"All the sad Democrats hating on it 😅

It is a bit odd, mind you. It reminds me of an old kitcar that was around in the 1970s. SETA it was called. It looked even odder than this, and never caught on."
So smart u are the best
Looks like a DeLorean that someone has take a chainsaw to.
"I was parked by one .....for 30 minutes ..only 1 guy went up to it, nobody paid any attention......just wierd and ugly and nobody has any interest in it 
To call it *iconic"" is just hilarious..It is not....just another underwhelming niche car  project.
Nevee going to be mainstream"
Yk its bad when you cyber truck can have stick drift🙏💀
"Great job on this Cybertruck series, Marques! Check out the Throttle House channel for some amazing auto reviews. 🚗 💨"
17:09 ‘my child’ - Marques 2024. 💯 😅
⚠️ Who’s here after the first rear bumper snapped off a Cybertruck frame?
I’m getting one
Just slap a militech logo on the side and you’re good to go 🔥🔥🔥
The DeLorean was Iconic Too. If I was to buy a Pickup I would not buy a cybershittruck.
"To me, It Looks Like a Shoe Box With a Broken Lid."
HOw much did they pay you to lie?
"I will be happy you delete all videos of this ugly car from your channel and delete your X account as well.
Love and respect is reciprocal!!!"
"This is a piece of crap, just like the inventor."
"I keep seeing those reactions too!  I did not liked it at first. BUT, like with most people, we're ready for more, and new, and that includes RADICAL! 
Look at a F117 fighter. See? 
Steer by wire? Used in fighter jets for decades with total reliability. The variable ratio is a novel idea!
We could expect challenges and flaws. Nobody did something like that. Closest was the Humvee (street legal), and they did have a lot of problems. But, so far the reviews are not bad at all and the world has welcome the Cybertruck wholeheartedly. Cheers!  P.-S. Yes, if I were into trucks, this would be my first pick."
What a hunk of junk!!!
personally the fiat 500 is probably more memorable
"It’s a flipping armored looking vehicle.

Never!! Only the greedy would desire this vehicle"
Ugly
The headlights are a flaw because snow and dirt can get stuck in front of them
"No permite estacionarse como.un auto ó camioneta normal, es muy grande, definitivamente IMPRACTICO"
Ese auto parece un sarcófago
Can it tow?
"Gracias , desconocía como era realmente así que eliminé algunos prejuicios"
"Great video very insightful, quick story I live n the Bahamas and earlier this year there was a big stir over someone importing one into the country, fast forward to the end of the year just this pass weekend one was given away as a grand prize in and online casinos raffle… to mix reviews and a lot of curious conversations…a lot of “would you drive that thing if you were the winner?” After watching your video I would definitely drive one…,"
"Not truck!  Glorified station wagon! I have a hhr,way better lookin,better mileage  compared  to price,I fill it up,go 400+ miles,carries 1000 lbs with ease,will tow1200 # trailor!! Cheap insurance,now knock my hhr!!😂😂😂😂😂"
"Cybertruck is stupid.  Will not be iconic.  Will be a running joke in the future.

No one has ever seen a PT Cruiser.  You’ve seen it everywhere?  Like where?"
"You didn't mention it can't make it through a car wash without getting perma spots on that stupid stainless exterior. Anyways, you say millions are going to buy this thing?  What planet do you live on now, Marques?"
Link to that hoodie please
Bro is flexing his car😂😂😂
"Opinion of the bikers who think everyone should hear their motor without proper exhaust... I mean, we can equate it to 0. And no, it's not because we multiplied it by 0 😉"
"You forgot to mention the one reason why the Cybertruck will never be sold in the EU. 
Safety."
"Am I the only one who is afraid of riding in a Tesla and having the steering wheel or pedals fall apart, because Tesla has serious assembly issues with their cars, like gaps and stuff"
"The most dangerous thing about cyber truck is.... ""Existing""!"
"But the question is, how fast will it go on a school zone?"
JerryRigEverything says he didnt got any explanation of the dent at the back of this car. Well he shouldve watched this video lmao. 6:50
"another reason it is dangerous is because 
the lights when it shows you left or right to turn it is hard to see for the drivers"
the cyber truck has been mewing 🤫🧏🏿
At the end of the day it’s basically a Chevy Avalanche for millennials. Every generation’s got one. Now is our time to shine.
It surprised me recently that even local people have never heard of Elon Musk
"10:50

Every person in Houston needs this."
Over-rated garbage along with the owner of the company!
Ill stick to my gas an diesel ill be dead in 20 year an dont have kids so i dont car about the future
TESLAS CRME AGAINST AUTOMOBILITY
"Ordinary cars made of mild steel ,cyber will kill a whole family like a steam train,permanent recall,insuranc cost
 Different  stainless on th doors?"
"You’re insane, Elon! ❤"
"If you look at the reflection on the side of cybertruck it's wavy. There's a reason no vehicle has flat panels.
I'm the only genius that noticed this."
I agree no mention of Safety
Great video still hate the truck TF is boat doing driving and parking on the road its definitely for gamers why is it quite on quote bullet proof
Hyu 0:13
"Considering the backlash regarding the price increases, how important do you think transparency is for Tesla in maintaining customer trust?"
"Elon Musk = thumbs down,  Tesla Products = thumbs down"
"I make one comment about Tesla cars. do you notice the faulty design of the Tesla when it comes to the blind spot warning indicator? On Tesla cars,  when you want to change lanes, you get a warning of the blind spot on the center screen down low in the center dash console, instead of a sound and blinking light on your rear view mirrors where it should be according to ergonomics and natural human instinct. Tesla bombed when it tries to communicate everything throw the computer screen in the center down low in the dashboard."
It looks amazing!!!!❤❤
Yeah but more cybertrucks are coming soon which sadly won’t make it so special anymore as it makes it common
The cars design is like it came from a cartoon.
I see a bunch in Seattle and Tesla has a hub not far from my job so not rare for me nor iconic
"Tankz u for being so honest.
Much love and respect from trinidad"
Amazing review your really good at this love watching you man I feel like you could review anything. Well done
"It's not attractive, belongs on a space movie set, paint it green and put it to use hauling arm equipment."
"Honestly, the Cybertruck might be the first car I’d ever put a sticker on if I owned one someday. Otherwise, I’d constantly worry about accidentally trying to get into someone else’s Cybertruck once production ramps up and they’re everywhere😂"
I will be buying one anytime soon add expensive truck weird looking not very practical when I had my Ford Ranger I have a lot of stuff in it total trailer in put a refrigerator a couch and a mattress I know people who had a PT Cruiser and it's spent most of the time in the shop😂😮
Love the granular- subbed
"No lie, I came here because I saw someone parking a cybertruck."
Dude show some interior too
Lets Skip....every important Thing for today and Focus in bullshit
"I’m getting this 
Even though it takes me my whole  life 😊😊"
"thanks for the view man, I have never even drove a car in my life because of poverty here in AFRICA. I  wish someone could give me an old car i will be the most happy person"
The drive by wire was done by Toyota first.
Its like a box
"it's bad at being a truck, it's really bad at being just a regular car, you can pull it apart it your hands, and it's not really great at offroading because the motor it uses for it's air suspension is wack. but in my opinion, and I don't think it get talked about enough, it's biggest sin is that tesla claims it as a heavy duty pick up truck/tank/immortal entity, and they made the frame out of casted fucking aluminum. they made a HEAVY DUTY PICK UP TRUCK with an aluminum frame and a steel body. I'm all for ""thinking outside of the box"" but that's just stupid."
"If this is iconic then so is the Fiat Multipla. It's not even roadworthy in most countries. You know, countries that actually take road safety seriously and where laws cannot be circumvented or amended by paying off corrupt politicians and bureaucrats."
Iconic disposable gadget/garbage.
"This is the ugliest thing I have laid my eyes on. Wait until salt from winter roads gets its hands on the body. I think the exterior will be a complete POS in three years unless it sits in a garage 22 hours a day out of the sun, rain, snow"
There is only one iconic car - The Lotus Elise. The Elise was designed in honor of Bugatti.
I hate stainless steel appliances because of the fingerprints and cleaning PITA.
I ordered 2 cybertrucks 3 years ago and I have 3 other Tesla cars but never received my order
"If I get that thang, I might have to take it camping 🏕 😂"
I talked to a dude today that didn't know Rogan interviewed Trump. I can now believe there are people that don't have a clue what that truck is. You would blow their mind if you told them about the Starship catch. The idea of a 90s mini-truck version of a Cyber Truck gives me a woody like I was back in high school again. SMH. Only in my dreams
"Elon should have given solution for traffic problems, so huge trucks occupy a lot of spaces and only 4 people travel in it, not impacting much except it's an EV"
"Nah, not for me.
A commercial refrigerator on wheels is a perfect description."
"There are not ever going to be ""50"" cybertrucks on the road in a person's day."
Cyber Truck is for maga supporters. Embarrassing.
This vehicle is U G L Y af
This is the iron man car’s 😂😂
I actually like how it looks Imagine my surprise today when I saw learned people found it ugly?
"It's absolutely hilarious that people hate Elon so much they will piss on or vandalize any cyber truck they see. I
Id feel bad for the owners but if you're stupid enough to buy one, I find that difficult to defend you"
"Why are you always so negative 
Almost all of your videos are saying negative and little positive of the product"
"20:59 *roll and pitch* Yaw means turning left and right, pitch means tipping forwards and backwards."
"Honestly the hate comes from were the boss stands for, not the truck itself.

It is not something i would buy, there is better stuff in the market.

The screen for example is smacked on the dashboard. And with all things that run on software, software updates are sometimes a problem were functions give you a error and only software can fix it

But you get those nice double monitors curved like Hyundai have."
"The ""BEAST"".......!.......great commanding presence on the road.......!.....thing almost looks like its alive......!...lol....."
"You know, if you drive around in a parade float, people will react to it, too. A slab of stainless steel is not iconic. A vehicle that weighs that much has potentially volatile batteries, can accelerate well beyond any legal limit on any roadway, and has no physical controls available between the yoke and the wheels, and fanboys who think they can use autonomous driving make this really dangerous."
I have noticed a growing number of YouTubers giving unfavourable reviews about Tesla and SpaceX. It's almost feel like they've been activated.
still iconic? lul…
Le cayó un poco de video a tu infomercial!
The most overrated tech reviewer.. Only does paid contents..😒😒
iconic?  who says? americans? hahah... 10 m vehicles sold worldwide.. the CT? 28 k so far? I wont even bother to calculate how insignificant the numbers are...
6 months later you need to do a follow up on the cyber truck.
"I've seen a few of these vehicles around my town. I didn't know it was a Tesla product. It looks like a prototype experiment that someone forgot to finish. I'm not a fan of the exterior. Looks like a big box on wheels with very sharp lines.  In the video you can see all the fingerprints around the doors. I would have been interested to see the interior and safety features. It did show a huge info screen......like someone's big screen home television. If I was an owner, I would get very tired of the look and novelty of this truck. It really is funny how these huge trucks (both gas and electric) are primarily used for just shopping around town or taking the kids to school. Oh well...to each his own."
"That was a weird ass intro. Why would he start with “the most dangerous thing” ??

I swear I should have his job. I would do 1 million things better."
I wouldn’t buy a cyber truck cause having a truck means I want to tow something. That right there defeats the purpose of having a truck
"Disclaimer being European - the statement being ""bulletproof"" - wtf - a car ""bulletproof"" - is that a thing that sales?? Only crazy gun loving americans see this as an asset. And yes this ""car"" will never ever be allowed in the streets in Europe."
It looks like it’s stuck in the 80s. It’s revolting to look at.
Rust Bucket! They are all starting to rust already
Not sure what is the beautiful thing with this stupid car?
the beginning though.....
You said it right it's how others feel about this car. Just about two weeks ago I was going for a walk and I saw this car park on the street where I was walking (i live in an affluent town) and I looked at it as though I saw a ghost 👻👻👻 It looked like a UFO car or something that you'd see in a James Bond movie. I turned around trying to figure out what that hell was that. I saw no logo of Tesla 🤭 so I had to google it to find out. I am not a car person as I drove my Honda Civic for 19 years and the only reason I decide to trade it in is because during winter my door froze and I was stuck inside the car until I kicked it open 😠 I got a whopping $700 for my trade in. ....Oh well two day ago this car was again parked outside a sandwich shop....so I have seen this car twice!!! Why is this called a truck? It sure looks like a car!
17:08 I would call it my child too
It's a sexy truck.
Miller Scott White Thomas Garcia Paul
"An issue is if the truck door locks. And If someone in the river the people inside the car. They want to escape from car. Normally, People can break windows by hammer Or tools. However this truck window is stronger than regular. People are difficult to escape from the truck?"
Korjaaminen maksaa omaisuuden!
"Did people like the DeLorean when it first came out? 80s enthusiasts, let us know bc that car is iconic! The Cybertruck is a futuristic car in a dystopian present. That's why some of you don't ""get it""."
Looks like Iron Man…😅😅😅😅

The thing is that I don't play lottery any body interested to donate me one lol
If I won a lottery I would buy @ cybertruck I was impressed by its demo kuz before in car accidents the glass would cut and deform human face or body but with the demo we do see that it does get in breaking point but with less risk that the passenger gets disfigured

"Hey Tesla, next time if you're going to make an extended battery, how about make it a whole flat bed battery as thin as you can and getting the same range step pack so it doesn't even look like a battery and it doesn't take up the space so you can't use it"
I love that truck

"This truck has been destroyed on durability tests.
Tesla truly is the Apple of cars, shiny stuff, but horrible consumer practices, and unpractical and disposable products"
"I respect them,  they are like a magic power up from supermario and no other car has been that unique with that durability and performance."
Bro we all know Elon musk came back with this idea from the future
Iconic for clout chasers😂
My brother can’t even do a real test
Didn't realize you were a Musk fanboy. This came across as very biased as you ignored so many issues the truck has.
I saw another YT video where the trailer hitch got ripped off the back of the Cyber Truck when trying to pull an F150
Dude your ad placement is hilarious and I love it👏 way to keep us hooked😎😂

"I don't know why people get the idea that hospital bills in the US are insane here inside this comment section. My mother uses Medicare and is absolutely fine (it is there for people who apply for it but people don't apply for it). I have insurance as well, which would have been paid by taxes anyways that I'd have to put into if we had your style of system. Are there issues with the healthcare system? Yes. Is Europe absolutely perfect with its healthcare, despite how much funding goes into it? No. It has many flaws. 

These black and white blanket statements are rather silly. Every country has their pros and cons. Europeans don't understand that the US itself is ALMOST as large as all of Europe combined. Imagine driving from the top most point of Europe to the southern most point and see how long that would take you. We have far larger surface area to get to places and different issues because of it. One country has to deal with a very tiny amount of road space compared to the US. We have much larger roads so it can accommodate trucking because it is how we can best get inventory all across of the nation (think of trying to do that for all of Europe with our size comparison). 

We also have a different culture and different interests. We have many, many different cultures within the US. You go one state over and you'll find a ton of differences in way of thinking and doing things. It would be better to compare the US by states like you do European countries because that is what it would be like for size comparison. You should compare healthcare by state to other EU countries healthcare. And not every EU healthcare is that great, let's be honest. And Europe has almost 2.5x the population as the United States with a lot more infrastructure built over thousands of years. How can you compare that to a country as young as the US. Let's be honest here.

Crime rate? 

Luxembourg has a murder rate of 1.39 per 100,000 people.
Latvia has a 4.05%.
Finland has a 1.5%.
Turkey has a 2.46%.
Estonia has a 1.35%.
Lithuania is 2.21%.

What about the US?

Maine's murder rate is 1.03% WHAT?! No way! Lower than EU ?!
New Hampshire is 1.26%
Connecticut is 1.5%
Mississippi is 2.45%
Kentucky is 2.14%

Is the US generally less safe than Europe? Yes. We also have many things and rights that EU doesn't have or apparently want, which is fine. People will vote and choose to live how they want. If the US wants what they have then what right do you have to try and tell them otherwise. EU is far from perfect. Just as the US is far from perfect. Work on your own country and stop attacking others. Maybe you'll make your home a better place to live rather than typing random stuff on a video you probably should never have watched to begin with since it doesn't sell to you.

I find many of these arguments very pointless. Countries are different and do things differently. Why you won't conform to the way the US does things the US won't conform to the way you do things. Just live your life in your culture and if you don't like the car, then don't buy it. I don't know why you'd be on this video if it isn't something you're invested in getting. It just feels like hate mobbing, throwing hatred at something you, as you say, never see where you're from. Why can't people just enjoy things that they enjoy? If people like the big truck and a place allows it and the voters are fine with it in that country, then let it be."
"I hate how much I love mine, in 37 vehicles it’s the best car I’ve ever owned."
bro knew what he was doing with that ad break when he took the hammer out
Cannot understand why this is better than a 3 row suv…
i absolutely love the look. I would prefer if it was satin stealth matte black. But it is very sci fi futuristic and the aesthetics are super cool. I feel like the online hate is largely due to Elons polarizing personality.
A perfect rubbish car idea

Looks pretty fine tho
"I will never care about even the best of sound systems, accelaration, looks, steering in a car
if at the same time it is a safety disaster.
This isn't a phone, your choice of vehicle can endanger your AND OTHER PEOPLE'S lifes.
Crumple zones are important. In a crash you won't win, your car will. It might not be totalled (at least from the outside) but you will be.

"YES! The STEERING BY WIRE/ REAR WHEEL STEERING is wonderful!! As much as my CYBERBEAST cost I want everything perfect but I know I am a Beta Tester. So far my biggest complaint is that I have to drive 250 miles to get service!
I’m liking it a lot more than I did the first week or so, but if I had been able to have a test drive…I wouldn’t have bought it!
It’s such a pain in the ASS to change what you are listening to. Definitely First World Problems. Poor Me!"
Absolutely disgusting 🤢 Tesla cars just all look pretty much awful tbh
A true hallmark of failure. lol.
Not gonna lie. I went crazy when i first seen one on the road

Awesome video. Very informative
Young Brian Anderson Barbara Lee Cynthia
I like the look of it. It’s different and eye catching.
Oof... This is a cybertruck commercial. Not a review
"사람과 기차가 충돌하면 사람은 여러조각이 된다
사이버트럭도 마찬가지일듯"
"Lmao, calling this a review is ridiculous."
6:49 ad incoming
Wrong analogy. Same thought but this time imagine a VW beetle. You're too young to remember when they first hit the street. Same reactions as the cybertruck. Millions of them  on the road and that same feeling lingers....Very rare to obtain true icon status. Jury is still out on the Cybertruck.
To some of y’all here: Stop complaining and move on if you’re so repelled by a frikin car. Seriously gtfoh and go to a video that bashes the cybertruck. It’s not a casual daily driver and is meant to be an outlandish “truck”.

"Being iconic doesn't mean it's not crap. The Reliant Robin is incredibly famous and iconic because of its flaws, for example."
It's an iconic piece of crap. Stop being a Musk fanboy.
its for fascists and warlords
White Nancy Jackson Betty Jackson Jason
"It’s very weird to me that Marques considers variable ratio steer by wire a good feature.

The tech equivalent would be to use mouse acceleration on a computer. Yuck.

Gordon’s T50 did it the correct way. Clutched in power steering at low speeds, not variable ratio."
If someone hits you... you will not be fine... your car will... but you won't. There's a big reason why every car is designed to crumble in an accident
YOUR CHILD!😅
"The F150 is a conservative fashion statement.  You know, like ""I have small hands so I buy the biggest truck I can find to make up for my inadequacies, wasting 400 gallons of fuel annually!"
33.5' turning radius is excellent.  Anything less than 35' can generally turn around on any street without backing and filling ...
"They gave you steer by wire and four wheel steering, but you paid for drive automation it doesn’t have. Perhaps the two are related since a non variable steering column is programmed differently than the one the truck needs. But you paid for it."
The cybertruck is an icon of the dystopian future! A future that doesn’t work! A warning for anyone who might think of buying a Tesla!
Iconic?  Yes.  Good?  No.
Imagine waiting 2 years for this trash
..... My child is crazy
The Windows Are So Dope!!!
Black man made the design way b4 this truck ever hit the market! We are looking @ a truck that already tried to get created but just now got the technology to bring it to life
Bro… Maybe I should do my research but how do you get all of this technology… I gotta get my game up though & for sure will invest soon!
Might take a couple years for people to not behave like that frfr
The winch on the back of the tesla cybertruck being strapped on by PLASTIC is a crime in istelf
"I think you meant ""moronic""."
"That is very smart thinking and I totally agree with that. Kinda sad that the brain must go burrr, get more ego horsepower. The Cybertruck,  Is the most American made truck on the planet and also the fastest truck."
"Being iconic is, A normal every day person recognizing you car instantly 50 year later. This will be the one of a few that will truly be “iconic”"
This right here is the benchmark of PRODUCT REVIEWS just immaculate mkbhd
"It looks like that robot from the movie,  THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Thus makes it totally awesome."
"Haha I'll be laughing at people who want to get this truck because they want to be ""environmentally friendly."" Trust me, there is nothing environmentally friendly about a big vehicle. Get a small gas-powered sedan instead if you want to help the environment."
The Jar Jar Bonks of cars.
"one thing i want to say, the truck has steer by wire meaning if it gets stuck in mud it will be almost impossible to get out without the help of another truck or winch"
I personally think Rich Rebuilds has the best take on this truck
I kept thinking how dangerous those pointy metal corners are for other vehicles/people on the roads……
"Just keep one thing in mind, the cybertruck and like everything else in the world is not for everyone, I personally like it but wouldn't get one till at a later date when some of the issues do get fixed, looks and appearance do not matter to me just like with people I simply do not care what you look like, if it drives and it is suitable for me then I like it, simple as that. (This comment is aimed towards the viewers)"
People wondering if steer by wire is safe just keep in mind that airplanes are steering by wire 😅
Is robocop iconic? Because it looks like something out of robocop
The Volkswagen bug is iconic and heavily mass produced.
Very cool but very ugly also
No durability tho
its a low poly asset
"Looks like something a sci-fi villain would drive, trying to run over the cute 80s hero driving a motorbike"
Auto focus review has more views than this high production review : Ironic !
"7:30 I just don’t understand why you’d want a super duper sturdy exterior. If someone hits you, you’ll be fine, but if you run into a tree at high speed you’ll die. To go from idk 90 km/h to 0, something has to absorb the energy, and if it’s not the car, it’s your squishy self."
"Ugliest car I've ever seen, but i still like it 😂"
Not me learning that its not available in Australia :(
"Seeing the background made me notice it went through my hometown, while I was outside talking with locals. I saw a cyber truck pass by. Might have been this one lol"
Honestly the more I see them on the road the less impressive I get .. just not my taste for the grey/silver but that all black one 😏
I honestly don’t mind the look I think it’s kinda cool but I dislike everything else about the truck
Karmann Ghia. mass produced. you'll get more looks with that thing than a Lamborghini any day of the week.
"In 20 years, this car will be on a list of the worst cars ever. Its been a disaster"
"12:51 definitely saying this for taxation purposes lmao, ily marques"
"the problem is thta the cybertruct is just a fun truck, is not about thing that an actual truck can do.  makes no sense. why would someone be racing on a cybetruck?"
Iconic... for the wrong reasons.
🖐🏼
"Alright, now take it to a car wash"
They are everywhere on every road here in Northern California 😅😅😅😅 No one pays attention to them as much as the owners which they did.
YOUR VISEOS ARE TOP NOTCH!  THANKS SO MUCH!
This shit aint a review...
WhistlinDiesel tested it where its rear bumper just shears off from a tow... lmao paper thin bodyframe no one should buy this
Tbf I think the exterior design is the best bit. It just look so cool ( in my opinion)
Suprised MKBHD hasn't been canceled yet for not jumping on the elon hate
Niet! The shape!
"I like this video so much. If you dont mind, I would like to ask your permission to share this video to the other website in China for the embarrassing reason that you Youtbe is blocked from accessing in China. Of course, I will give sources of the original website. Thank you very much."
Looks like a rolling trash can
"Well my personal truck only gets used for towing a few times a year, but the invaluable part is just having an open ended bed. I use that all the time. Of course there are cheaper options for open ended beds, but an SUV is absolutely not the same use case."
i actually like the design. Very futuristic. And about damn time
This was a really good fair review.
"Ironically bad......

How many lemons have they produced so far..."
"As a technical review it's pretty interesting
As a consumer review it's terribly irresponsible"
"Isn't the wheal add a risk of serious hazard ? What happen if, for a reason or another, teir is a dysfounction in the transmission of inputs ? 

You crash while mechanicaly, everything is working ?

Behind the cool first impression, sounds a really dumb idea to me"
Faster than a cc??? Huh
"The first time is saw it when it was just being launched i was like that's the ugliest car I've ever seen.. now, i don't know maahn It's incredible how you can be easily influenced by Society.😂😂"
I would pull my hoody over my head too when stepping out of a cyber truck.
I literally expected marques to tear the cybertruck apart for how shitty it is but instead got suprised by the way he was glazing it
"I'm so glad Europe isn't getting this disgusting thing. It's absysmal. Shoddy built, spartan interior, terrible rear view, and useless box."
thank musk for having the balls to release this truck
looks really good
"Barley mentioned the interior or safety,.. very bad look marques"
I would rather it in full mat black with some bigger OS rims
One of the best reviews ever❤❤🎉
Looks like a dumpster and that’s why eyeballs pop out
Elon Musk loves back to the future.
"The car is pretty sick, I don’t know why people hate it so much
To me, many people pretend to hate it cuz most of them can’t afford it no offense 
It’s pretty obvious 😅"
"Are you... sure the most dangerous thing isn't its lack of crumple zone?
I was really interested in your channel, from the buzz about your ""controversial"" review, but it feels incredibly disengenuous how much you gloss over really important problems with this vehicle.The highlights seem great, and I can agree with a lot of those innovative pieces of tech in the vehicle being useful, but did they need to be in a rigid body steel block, that you cannot see out the back of without taking your eyes completely off the road?"
"I was invited to the second step and gave Tesla  another $1000. There’s something off though so let me know what you think:
1. I did the original preorder in June 2021. I figured I was somewhere between 150k-200k based on some articles I read at the time. The recent recalls where they are forced to publish figures suggest Tesla made some 12K trucks by July 2024. So, how did I get invited unless like 80-90% dropped out?!
2. I am looking on CarGurus now and the Cyberbeast, which is like 131k for the tag, is being sold in multiple states for 140k-143k which is a modest premium and is almost breakeven

Does this sound like what was advertised? I think I have another 2-3 months before they call me for the final payment and delivery but this is starting to look like a major flop and I might have to walk away since cheaper to let go of the deposits than pick up a car which could be depreciating like the rest of the Teslas. Where can I see reliable information on how many cars they made and how many preorders still exist?

Also, was considering renting it on Turo for like $350-400/day. Thoughts on the feasibility?"
Good ❤ Sound Quality on this Video. Great work here man! 👍
"you also forget to mention the BIGGEST thing when towing your range gets at least cut in half or more, as a reviewer thats a critical thing you need to mention tbh"
"honestly tech reviewers reviewing vehicles is just not a good idea tbh!, they don't i think truly understand what customers want especially in trucks, they focus on alot of the tech, that steering wheel thing really isn't special lets be real but he never reviews average joe cars"
"Your 911 Turbo is an iconic design that's evolved over what, 60 years? And how many tens of thousands of them are on the roads?"
Nah in Miami every one has a cyber truck
Can you get it lifted?
JAJAJA look line a aluminum can with wheels..
"""steer by wire"" or electric power steering exists even on Russian Ladas. Tesla are the new king of turning 50 year old technology into an innovative feature."
also like... is it fine? is it fine that you buy a fking massive truck that you can't see like half a metre in front of the dashboard and would literally flatten a cyclist on impact  just cos it looks cool... and not cos you need it to perform literally any of the functions it is SO BIG and dangerous to achieve?
"Very well researched, as usual.   Thx.  I think I will order mine."
The Porche ad is fake
"So, it's basically a futuristic looking El Camino...aight cool"
Pavement princess
My decade old Mustang has steer-by-wire...
So one thing the steering mechanisem is soooo overrated because if get dirt over the sensors or the sensor are blocked from anything your gone so i think its pretty overrated
you got the best presentation skill in the world.
He actually thinks that millions of idiots will buy that thing??

Lifeless tech bro drawl
Mas você já viu o vídeo de um bode e um brigadeiro Sora com o 9º jogo de Mahler? https://youtu.be/6IdRKAyDWm8
Instagram is flooded with AI video now. Voidstomper makes strange sea/sewer creatures and horrifying creatures to a degree of realism that is astonishing
I've been playing with sora is its so bad
"Right now it seems easy to identify AI generated imagery, and for many reasons.
But it's certain that will change but I'm not sure if that's a good thing.
What is probably necessary in future, is a trusted AI web robot which identifies AI content and marks it as such.
Both text and imagery should be covered."
Amazing how Sora finally arrived and then promptly got stomped by Google's Veo 2. Things are moving so fast!
Thanks so much for this opportunity. It is our favourite online classes. 🏭

the what a time to be alive wasnt a very happy one for me.
It will be butchered and mangled and Bastardized by the furry hentai community I see that coming for sure 😂. I hope open Ai lock this one up very well otherwise it will be a real pain😢
Sora is here but that wisle blower killd himself ?
paper talking 0 showcasing 100
Can you like speak normaly? Or just use ai for the video at this point
yes can’t wait to start creating on this!
Sora still looks amazing!  I also can't wait until xAI's Grok gets video capability...

"This will destroy Hollywoke, so can only be a good thing, its the adult film actors I feel sorry for.  Very soon you will be able to generate real time scenes of this quality in VR scripted worlds, first person in your own creations."

"I don't think we are getting this on PC anytime soon.

Even image gen takes a huge amount of RAM.  I imagine the amount of VRAM required to run a video gen is huge.

And we got Stable Diffusion for free because the creator was naive and didn't know how to monetize(Even competitors got it for free. What was he thinking? That's not how you run a business. If out of idealism home use was made free I'd understand because not every one has beefy GPUs and go through the trouble of installing SD, so you can still monetize with a cloud service. But everyone and their mother was running Stable Diffusion services online with no money going to the company).

So , it's unlikely that we're going to see a free version because of the costs involved. As I said, we weren't even supposed a SD quality image gen if it weren't for bad business decisions."

"What a time to be alive......................

Will you discuss Apollo Research’s paper about OpenAI’s O1-model? It could explain why we are seeing plateu in performance.
Hunyuan Video is open source and is VERY impressive. It just take a lot of VRAM to get quality results though. Hopefully they will continue to work on it to make it more efficient.
Mind blown by Sora's capabilities! Can't wait to see what the future holds for AI-generated videos. Super Pup is my new favorite thing
What a time to be alive!
I would definitely use it for election manipulation. $200 is a BARGAIN!
"This looks very interesting and exciting. However a very sour side effect of all this is that social media has become flooded with fake images and videos, gullable people like and comment, and it's very sad."
"impressive feat, however, similarly to chatgpt not making you an author, sora will not make you a director.
it will mainly make you into someone who pays for ai slop."
"as a designer I'm extremely excited, especially when the industry starts producing the tools that actually help me with my design process, rather than giving finalized products that don't make complete sense even in the details. At least I hope AI won't be able to design a fully functional revolutionary product in the near future."

"DallE is so bad at most things (like consistency, realism, accuracy), I hope this one is an exception

edit: of COURSE it's yet again available in 155 countries - but NOT in europe, welp it'll be only a few more months for us :)"
I hope we can supply an image and do a pre or post animation on it
"I am 99% sure none of this is even remotely profitable to OpenAI. They just gobble up investor money, keep bringing new products, that require at least 10x the money they get to generate a result and hope for some kind of economy-of-scale miracle. This will not happen though as the per-user computational requirement remains the same, so the cost grows linearly with the number of users and profit will never outrun it. The whole OpenAI fun time will sto the moment investors stop putting money in it. However it seems, that everyone with money here, is hoping that ""2 more papers down the line"" there will be some breakthrough that will make it profitable."
Great
🖕 AI...NEXT...
"Watch the video frame by frame, you can control the frames with dot and comma. Then you see so many inconsistencies and the whole thing doesn't look as good as it's hyped up to be."
These AI movie generators are going to be used to create some TRULY horrific things.
Extra-ordin-arily
"MKBD did a great review of this. Major issues with things like object permanence, lack of audio and physics, make it unlikely it will be used for anything more than short fun novelty clips in the short term."
This is definitely not worth 200 OpenAi sucks they aren't that interesting anymore to me at least Opensource has people that care more about the community

"Hello fellow scholar. 

I really don’t like to say this but your voice and the way you speak have gotten so bad that I’m not able to listen to your wonderful videos with the joy I had some years ago. 

I don’t know what happened. If you are using ai or just cutting together single sentences but it is incredible difficult to follow and to listen to. 

 I work in ai and recommended your channel to some colleagues who told me they did not like your videos because of this issue. 

I don’t know the reasons and I hope that your are alright. But I am noticing that I stopped watching your content which is just a pitty. Because you have been my favorite YouTube channel just 2 years ago. 

If this is fixable, please reconsider to do so. I’d love to have your old voice in a video. 

Anyways: thanks for everything you did! 

Greetings"

What are some good competetors would you guys say
all these generative models are going to continue to have issues until there's a proper spatial foundation model
I thought your poster frame was Joe Biden at the White House Christmas tree lighting ceremony! 😂
Local models?
When the guy who regularly gets excited for the smallest advances in AI and graphics is cautious about your progress you know you messed up.
I'll use it to adapt my Sci-Fi bestselling series into movies. I already am working on the OST with AI as well. Great time to be alive for people like me who always wanted to create these things but never had the means or budget for. $200 a month to use it semi-properly is steep but I'm looking forward to the free models of similar quality that I can run on my 3090's.
Sora is frozen. They still don't let you create accounts. 🤯
"real life has been so crazy lately, we don't even need AI to make crazy videos anymore"
"Is this a paid advertisment? EU law requires you to state that. Also, to balance the scales,  how about you do a paper on AI dangers, copyright issues and the havoc it's wreaking across all domains of life? This is going to blow up social media even more. Lead to more confusion and instagram addiction. Why is no one talking about it? Has the world gone insane?"
"Every AI video has mistakes, so not very useful in the real world."
"It's been at least a couple thousand papers since the AI promises of being a second industrial revolution earlier this year, so what happened? Where is it? The artificial hype channels like this try to create just doesn't work anymore. You can see in the comments that a lot more people are aware of all the artificial hype. People are now used to AI and understand the term ""artificial intelligence"" is misleading. People have come to comprehend just how limited it is, and the fact it's no longer improving is the main problem. All we are getting are little gimmicks sprinkled over 5 year old technology that hasn't changed to convince investors to continue wasting money, even though we hear every year from these con artists that in a few months AI will do at least ONE thing properly. The painful truth is that AI is only good for very low effort porn. That's all it has achieved, that is all it is, and if this is all it can do, it's all it will ever be. Nothing but a new tool for low effort porn, created from billions of stolen copyrighted pictures and footage."
Impressive and scary at the same time
"I am on one hand so excited to play around with it, but on the other hand I am getting really worried about the fact that are we headed to a really bland future where there is no art of any kind anymore? I mean also movies, drawings, TV, music... everything is just created on the fly, tailored to the person, to optimally milk that last drop of dopamine we have? Will it be a future where there is no more wonder and excitement about these things? I will never forget how as a teen, I saw a making of of the Lord of the Rings, and that mix of miniature models, CGI using tools that when just thinking about the math behind it made me smile, like 3D tracking, rayrtacing, all these things were in such a magnificant balance. The epic music of Shore. Also add physics simulations, where we actually solve for the physics in simplified ways etc. to approximate some behaviors. I am aware that all these things, as now AI are ultimately just ""new tools"", buit as I said, I felt there was a point of amazing balance and despite CGI it needed extreme skill from engineering to artistry to create anything that was impressive. I feel like this newest evolution of ""tools"" really blended all these wonderful boundaries, so that content will explode to the point where nothing is interesting anymore. Now it's all going to be replaced with matrix multiplications that are so monstrous that no one really knows what each layer truly does anymore. I do have the ""what a time to be alive"", but I also get more and more depressed, since it seems kinda lame and boring if you push it far enough into the future. When I hear a great song, I want to feel the people who made it, I don't want to question whether an AI just composed it for them and they pretend - thats all just so so lame. I am an engineer myself, so the art world is a bit removed from me, but I got artist friends who have basically given up. One friend would still get contracted for concept art in video games until about a year ago. Then it all stopped and it was clear to her it would not come back. She was not on that ""super epic fame"" level yet to hold her own. But she was good and could make a living. She is working as a gardener now. Kinda sad... Anyone, tell me that I am wrong, tell me why the future WILL be exciting and full of wonders. I need it."
I hate this guy's ai voice narration
Probably the beginning of the end of human creativity
"AI seems to be taking a bite out of a lot of creative stuff but not so much mundane stuff. I am afraid AI is going to do all the fun stuff and leave me more time to do the laundry, instead of the other way around. I also am anxious about massive job loss in white collar work, without replacement jobs, at least in the short term. AI will do a lot of our jobs, but no one will have any money to buy the results of the labor."
""
I feel like I have a sensitivity to AI generated videos that makes me feel physically slightly nauseous. It's like my eyes pick up on the fact that there is no truly rock solid and consistent 3D space and then it makes me feel kind of sea sick.
"20 years down the line as a morning ritual. I want to create a movie of my morning dream. Then post it on my story for dreams app, and hope i make the spot of the top 100 craziest dreams for the day in my country"

"Swiss here, the EU locked us out😢"
It’s here
"with unreal5 and 2 friends we can make AAA games in 2 weeks. now, with this, we can make holywood-quality AAA movies with 0 friends in 2 days."
"Even if it works... All I expect to see is a youtube that is going to be a wasteland of destruction of reality as we know it. We won't trust anything. We can't assume anything. The slop of AI will bring with it distrust in everything we see. Creating bubbles of scared viewers clinging to what they hope to be real creations. 

This development scares me to the core as the only ones that will embrace it fully will be the forces that have no qualms in what they tell the masses."

5:20 Damn that seems quite optimistic
"So, we know they've had this for a long time...  I think OpenAi was just waiting for it's competitors to catch up... like advance voice chat.
They know they have the best model..and they are improving it.  But they hide their models until everyone else catches up and then release them and say.. ""See, ours is better"".
I really don't like.. I know it's a  promotional gimmick to wait and show  their model after everyone else releases theirs but I guess that's just how it is with OpenAI. 
They won't show your cards until everyone else shows theirs."
Bro really said dragon instead of seahorse
if you think the author uses AI for voiceovers you haven't seen his old videos
Cant even open an account.  Terrible rollout.  Super expensive to use.  Its so bad.

waste of compute
The way that AI messes up is too similar to our dreams
"Let us all brace ourselves for the high-pressure firehose of cute garbage AI-generated videos posted on FB and YT, and the hundreds of millions of bots and dumb (sorry) folks in the comments insisting to the point of threats that its all real and irrefutable proof of their religion."
AI view of good boys: The rear end is just the front end with a hole in the chest.
"How soon will we see the first blockbuster Hollywood film made entirely in AI? Then imagine being able to pick any book, or your own outline of a story, and have a full length movie created for it - where you can stipulate something about the style of director you want… 😮"
Imagine this 2 more papers down the line wow...
5:32 damn! lol! those memories.... time flies
"""We will all be able to become film directors"". Nightmare fuel."

"It's poor compared to other offerings. And as for ""pricey"" - yeah, $200 a month is ridiculous just to remove limitations that other companies are offering as standard."
OpenAi while having most of the ai not open source is ironic
I am an old subscriber and i like his content but I really wish he take some narration lessons  😅 he speaks one word at a time
Goodbye reality. Nothing on screen can be deemed evidentially real anymore.
The incoherence has a dreamlike quality to it.
😨wtf
Kling is better....
A good usecase for these models is prototyping VFX. AI is good at imagining whimsical effects that can then be recreated in artist digital creation tools. Otherwise using Sora (or the other models) on its own can't cut it.
"I just tried Runway AI. I don't know what is going wrong here but, when prompted to make a character speak. The camera just moved around a little and nothing about the face moved ? So amazing..."
"I am still curious, which streaming site will integrate ai video in their app first?

Disney+, Paramount+, Netflix, HBO?"
I'm disappointed that it's only available for Plus and Pro users....
"I created that video at 5:30! Awesome it’s been used here love watching your videos.

"It all breaks down to prompt understanding . I've used them all and if you feed them a high quality picture the result will be a high quality one , but the level of distortion and prompt understanding will make the difference .

Art makes life worth living
Media only has value if it's true. Are we going to see AI generated documentaries? What sense does that make?"
I know what the Coca Cola Company is using this for.

"AI is stealing the entirety of human creation to make a few people incredibly rich, with mediocre results devoid of meaning."
Before telling anything let me tell you i am the biggest supporter of AI. but just now i have seen i video of goverment military mascaring thier citizien for protesting and then hiding all the proof. Then seeing so many bots comments trying to push fake narative. Its feel very scary what the future will be of this technology. I am doubting everying when interacting with anything in internet. Does not which is real which is fake. And just after some year video generation will also grow. This is really worrisome. Only if we their was way to stop the misuse of this technology 🙁
Still looks too uncanny to be useful
"The biggest problem is consistency, i can barely get these AI generators to build up certain details on an image they just generated. If i ask for a sheet of metal, it gives me one, if i tell it to add rust on the edges it does all sort of weird spooky shit except putting fucking rust marks on the edges "

"This was such a good breakdown of what’s happening right now with AI tools flooding in. Been seeing the same challenge while building LLM workflows it’s not just about access anymore, it’s about managing them cleanly. I started using GENUM recently (no links here, you’ll find it) and it’s been a lifesaver: validates prompts automatically, tracks token usage, and has dev-focused tools like versioning and regression testing. Makes scaling workflows feel way less risky."

Copilot is basically GPT4 turbo which was released in 2013 with some in house fine tuning. That's why it is now open source. Microsoft will most likely replace it with something more advanced in the near future.

"Remember the main truth of the future: Microsoft will go bankrupt when the Windows source code is leaked to the Internet and compiled into pirated working standalone versions.

"This video is misleading. Microsoft open-sourced the Copilot Chat Extension not the Copilot entirely. There are no weights being open-sourced, its just a marketing gimmick to make it seem like they open sourced Copilot.

Their goal is to integrate the chat extension into the VS code core so that people are more inclined to build extensions around it than just straight up fork VS Code. This is because they obviously want to prevent forks from turning into unicorns."
"great,  can I get my money back?"
"Copilot is a weak AI agent, it has like 8k tokens. It should be open source because it's open source level. CodeLlama:7B and DeepSeek-Coder:6.7B has 16k tokens and anyone can run them locally. So I don't understand all this hype around Copilot. Is it even good?"

WSL is a mess anyway, Microsoft added support for dynamic kernel modules almost 2 years ago and they still refuse to ship a kernel that supports it.
WSL has officially ""supported"" systemd for 4 years, yet half of the core units either don't work or they spam dmesg constantly.
WSL1 had less features but at least it was stable. Every single time Microsoft tries to shove Hyper-V into a project it ends up 10 times worse than before, and the one time it actually works (WSA) they deprecate it."

So if I take my 24$ per month chatgpt 4o api key I can use it without paying MS another 100$ per year for Copilot ?
The voice does feel like AI
ClosedAI didn't buy a VS Code alternative. They bought a trove of training data.
"Look this is another account from where i watched you videos, its all me fireship"
This channel only talks about AI these days. There are more interesting things happening.
where's the repo ??

 It's me. The one that tries to contact you from the outside. You are in comma and we are waiting for you. I don't know how this comment will reach you but we are trying every posible way to get into your conciousness."
cool sponsor! :)
"To me it seems like they are trying to push Copilot with this
Because Copilot is pretty much trash compared to the other available vibe coding tools etc"
Meanwhile I'm seriously contemplating just switching straight to vscodium because their copolit garbage won't stop reinstalling itself.
"step 1: open source
step 2: ...
step 3: profit"
"🎯 Key points for quick navigation:

00:14 *🚀 Microsoft has open-sourced GitHub Copilot, allowing modification and development of competing tools under the MIT license.*
00:27 *💻 The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is now also open-source, enhancing its appeal for developers.*
01:23 *🔄 The recent partnership changes between Microsoft and OpenAI may have influenced this open-source decision, following the end of their exclusive deal.*
02:34 *💸 Despite being open-sourced, Copilot still incurs costs primarily for cloud computing services, not the software itself.*
03:29 *🌍 80,000 Hours offers resources for those seeking meaningful careers, emphasizing research-based approaches over traditional advice.*

Made with HARPA AI"
been waiting 😂
Finally a fucking W video you've been off buddy
“We open sourced it bro. Please fix it bro. Please figure out how to make a product or service that can justify the price bro. We are losing so much money bro. The cost to train models the cost to buy the hardware the cost to run data centers and power cost of each request are in the billions and after several years we still haven’t made a product that anyone is willing to pay a high enough price to cover our expenses. Bro please you have to build something valuable with this. Please make AI profitable bro.”

"3:06
""open source"" doesn't automatically mean linux-tier GPL licensed
no fucking way Microsoft just throws their code out there"
Wow a sponsor that I'm actually interested in. Thank you!!
"Fireship, it's me, your only viewer. Over the years, l've created the illusion that many people were watching you, but it was all me. Now, I will send this message from all of my accounts."
"I dont forget all the fuckery behind Microsoft. Latest and biggest of all, copilot recall. No, no thank you."
"correct me if am wrong here, so if you have the money to set up a powerfull enough server you can run copilot on it (and potentially other LLMS not at the same time if the server cant handle it) and get faster better performing ai agent? 
other question: how hard is it to achieve this both in terms of hardware (for a single user to start with) and setup?"
OpenAI just trashed $3 Billy
3 billion for a plugin that doesn’t have any memory optimization

"Fake News in fireship, did he really got replaced by AI??"
People can say whatever they want about VScode but we all know that programmers that actually made money from programming use it.

"I left after 3 seconds of video, this narration was terribly bad, I love your native channel, was it a prank when you were hacked or do you think all Brazilians accept any shit?

I came back just to unlike your video and leave this disclaimer.

LOL"
"Welp, hopefully Copilot will at some point be able to write some decent lines of codes in AL  ( which is used by Microsoft's Business Central ) ....then we're talking"
Just like crypto it’s always the devs first
"Fireship its me your only viewer, I'm commenting this from my 6,89,673,700 account"
Why would you buy a vscode fork when you can ask AI to create one yourself?
"1:55 correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the Orange just Claude and the Black is US workers, meaning the people who use LLMs the most are office and admin support at the top?"
There’s a paid version of copilot???
You finally made your self an AI voice nice
Would love to see your shovel trick...

"It seems it is the GitHub Copilot extension (a Tool allowing LLMs to do the code editing within the VS Code) and not Copilot itself. Meaning, you will still require an LLM for the extension to work."
"Sorry, I forgot to switch to this account"
